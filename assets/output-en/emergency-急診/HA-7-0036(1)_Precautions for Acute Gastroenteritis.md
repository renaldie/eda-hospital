## Precautions for Acute Gastroenteritis

1. During the acute phase, reduce or suspend eating. If thirsty during fasting, moisten lips with water or hold ice cubes in the mouth.

2. If anti-diarrheal medication is used, it can be temporarily discontinued when there is no ongoing diarrhea.

3. Avoid dehydration and pay attention to water and electrolyte replenishment. Diluted sports drinks (half water) can be consumed.

4. Try to avoid milk and soy products, oily foods, and spicy foods.

5. After symptoms improve, attempt to give plain water. If no discomfort occurs, gradually introduce small amounts of bland food (e.g., congee, rice water, white toast, juice).

6. If vomiting recurs, rest for several hours before eating again.

7. Prevention methods: frequent handwashing, attention to cooking environment, and emphasis on food hygiene.

8. Mild diarrhea can be managed at home. However, seek immediate medical attention if persistent vomiting, ongoing diarrhea, dehydration shock, pain shifting to the lower right abdomen, or high fever occurs.
