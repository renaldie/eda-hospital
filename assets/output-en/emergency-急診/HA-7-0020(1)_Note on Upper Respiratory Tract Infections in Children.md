## Upper Respiratory Tract Infection in Children: Precautions

1. Fever may occur intermittently for 3-5 days, which is a normal process. Please take medication as prescribed by the doctor and drink plenty of warm water. If the body temperature exceeds 38℃ without chills, an ice pillow can be used. If the body temperature exceeds 38.5℃, fever-reducing medication can be used.

2. When coughing severely, drink more warm water and avoid cold, sweet drinks and citrus fruits. When going outdoors, wear a mask to avoid cold air stimulation.

3. Adequate rest is required, and consume more vegetables and fruits.

4. When fever occurs, remain calm and pay attention to the child's mental vitality. If necessary, call to inquire whether an emergency room visit is needed. Regular outpatient follow-ups are also required.

5. If there are symptoms such as persistent high fever for several days, poor mental activity, large amounts of yellow phlegm, drowsiness, or inability to eat, please return for a follow-up as soon as possible.
