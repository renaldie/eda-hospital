## Usage Precautions for the Figure-Eight Shoulder Brace

1. Most clavicle fractures can be effectively treated with a figure-eight shoulder brace alone, while only a few cases require surgical intervention. The orthopedic physician will determine the appropriate course of action during an outpatient clinic visit.

2. The figure-eight shoulder brace should be worn for 4-6 weeks, or even up to three months. During the first 2 weeks, it is recommended to use an arm sling in conjunction with the brace to immobilize the affected arm and reduce pain.

3. For the first 1-2 weeks, it is advisable to take a shower rather than a bath. When showering, do not remove the figure-eight shoulder brace. If bathing is unavoidable, maintain proper posture and carefully remove the brace. After bathing, put it back on as soon as possible (with hands on the hips, chest upright, and family members assisting from behind to adjust the sponge pads on both shoulders and evenly tighten the two straps). If discomfort occurs, seek medical attention promptly.

4. Wear the figure-eight shoulder brace over a thin cotton shirt, not over thick clothing. When sleeping, lie flat on your back and avoid sleeping on your side.

5. Pain typically lasts for 1-2 weeks and can be managed with prescribed pain medication. Regular follow-up visits to the orthopedic outpatient clinic are necessary.
