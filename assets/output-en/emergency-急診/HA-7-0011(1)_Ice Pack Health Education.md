## Ice Pack Guidelines

1. For traumatic or inflamed wounds, use as directed by medical staff.

2. Place an appropriate amount of ice cubes into the ice bag and add water to one-third full.

3. Invert the ice bag to check for leaks, wrap the ice bag with a dry towel, and apply to the affected area.

4. Apply four times daily, each session lasting 15-20 minutes, followed by a rest period.
