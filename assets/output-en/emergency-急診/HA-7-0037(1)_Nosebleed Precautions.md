## Nosebleed Precautions

1. Avoid prolonged exposure to air-conditioned rooms or picking the nose, to prevent nasal mucosa from becoming dry and cracked, which may lead to nosebleeds or infections.

2. When experiencing a nosebleed, the priority is to stop the bleeding. First, have the patient sit upright. If necessary, insert a piece of tissue into the nostril. However, if bleeding cannot be controlled, apply pressure to the bridge of the nose or use an ice pack. (For trauma patients, do not block the nostrils arbitrarily to prevent aspiration of blood into the respiratory tract.)

3. If a hypertension patient measures a blood pressure higher than usual, take emergency blood pressure medication as directed by the physician, remain in a resting state, avoid excessive physical exertion or movement, and maintain a semi-reclining position while applying measures to stop the bleeding.

4. Follow the emergency physician's recommendations regarding medication and related medication precautions. Do not remove the gauze or cotton strips placed inside the nose after medical treatment, and return to the hospital for follow-up examinations as instructed by the physician.

5. If you regularly take anticoagulant medications (such as patients who have undergone heart surgery or suffer from cerebral infarction), aspirin, or have coagulation disorders (such as hemophilia, liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, or hematological abnormalities), or are a patient with head and neck cancer (such as nasopharyngeal cancer), seek immediate medical examination if bleeding cannot be controlled.
