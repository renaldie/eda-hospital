## Precautions for Children with Vomiting and Diarrhea

**Vomiting:**

Temporarily fast for several hours. If thirsty, try giving small amounts of water to soothe the throat, but avoid drinking large amounts of water which may trigger another round of vomiting. If vomiting persists, consult a physician for examination to check for dehydration or electrolyte imbalances, and intravenous fluid therapy may be necessary if required.

**Diarrhea:**

Initially, fast to allow the gastrointestinal tract to rest. During this period, give the child the prescribed "glucose-electrolyte solution" as directed by the doctor. Try to consume it at irregular intervals, but avoid undiluted sports drinks as their high sweetness may worsen diarrhea. After eight hours, if diarrhea improves, infants who primarily consume milk can be given half-strength milk (same water content but with half the amount of formula), while older children can stop consuming milk and begin eating bland foods such as rice water, rice flour porridge made with boiled water, or plain rice porridge and toast.

If diarrhea does not improve within one to three days, do not continue using diluted milk (any milk should not be diluted for long-term use). Instead, switch to special formula milk (such as lactose-free formula with dairy-based proteins or lactose-free formula with plant-based proteins) to reduce intestinal stimulation. At this time, the original milk should be completely paused until diarrhea improves, then gradually reintroduce it.
