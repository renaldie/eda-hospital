## Precautions for Febrile Seizures in Children

### 1. Causes of Febrile Seizures:

When a child has a fever and experiences convulsions in the entire body or in a local limb, often accompanied by temporary loss of consciousness, it is called a febrile seizure. It usually occurs within the first 24 hours of a fever, typically only occurs once, stops within a few minutes, and the child wakes up shortly afterward, without any subsequent paralysis or confusion. Fortunately, febrile seizures rarely occur after the age of five.

### 2. How to Handle Febrile Seizures:

Since simple, sudden febrile seizures rarely pose immediate danger and do not result in neurological complications, it is important to stay calm. First, lay the child flat on a safe, non-slip surface such as a bed or the floor. Measure the body temperature and use a rectal suppository to reduce fever. If the child is vomiting, turn their head to the side to clear the vomit and ensure airway patency. If there is no obvious tongue biting, do not place any objects in the child's mouth to prevent tongue biting, as inserted objects may cause choking or vomiting. Monitor the child's breathing and heartbeat. If the seizure continues for several minutes, seek immediate medical attention. For children who have regained consciousness, closely observe for signs of confusion, persistent vomiting, severe headache, stiff or painful neck, unrelenting high fever, or any signs of paralysis in the hands or feet.
