## Home Care Precautions for Indwelling Urinary Catheters

1. Urinary catheters are available in general material and silicone material. They should be placed and replaced at fixed intervals according to medical advice to avoid infection, and regular follow-ups at the urology outpatient clinic are required.

2. Clean the perineum with soap water twice daily, and replace the catheter fixation site daily.

3. Drink plenty of water to increase urine output, with daily urine volume needing to be maintained at least 1500cc.

4. The urinary catheter should be avoided from pressure and twisting, and should be regularly squeezed to prevent blockage.

5. The urine bag height should be maintained below the patient's waist to prevent urine backflow leading to infection. Empty the urine bag when the urine volume exceeds two-thirds of the bag's capacity.

6. If symptoms of urinary tract infection such as fever, chills, urethral pain, or hematuria occur, please seek medical attention immediately. Additionally, consume foods rich in vitamin C (such as oranges, tangerines, tomatoes, and papayas) to help prevent urinary tract infections.

7. Be careful to prevent the patient from removing the urinary catheter themselves, as this may cause urethral injury.
