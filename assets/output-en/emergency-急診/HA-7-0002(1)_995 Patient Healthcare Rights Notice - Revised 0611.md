## Medical Rights Information for Sexual Assault Victims

1. When you come to our hospital for treatment, we will not refuse your medical care without cause, and we will treat you as a first-level emergency injury assessment patient, giving you priority treatment.

2. If our hospital's facilities or technology cannot provide complete medical care, we will proactively arrange for your referral to another medical institution, and we will clearly inform you or your accompanying family members of the name and address of the referral medical institution, so that you can receive complete care.

3. When you receive medical care at our hospital, a social worker or nurse will accompany you during the injury assessment. If you need family members to be present, your family members may also be allowed to be present to assist you.

4. During the injury assessment and evidence collection process, we will provide a private and comfortable space to avoid unnecessary disturbances.

5. The medical and evidence collection costs incurred due to this incident during your hospital stay will be covered by your local county or city government. You will not need to bear any costs.

6. Regarding the results of your medical treatment, you, your spouse, or your legal guardian (if you are a minor who is unmarried, your parents are your legal guardians) may apply to our hospital for an injury assessment diagnosis certificate.

7. To protect your rights, during your medical treatment, we can simultaneously assist in evidence collection and injury assessment, which can serve as evidence for your report. When the physician conducts the medical examination, they may touch on more private areas of your body. If you feel uncomfortable during the process, please inform the medical staff, and they will assist you accordingly.

8. The collection of evidence and injury assessment will still require your consent and the completion of the injury evidence collection consent form before proceeding. The collected evidence will be stored in evidence bags and handed over to the police for subsequent assistance. These pieces of evidence will be strictly protected and will not be disclosed.

9. If you have any questions or do not understand something, you can consult the National Women and Children Protection Hotline at 113. We believe they will provide you with detailed explanations and guidance, and help you with further assistance.
