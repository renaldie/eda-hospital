## Self-Administering Eye Drops Guidelines

1. Wash hands thoroughly before and after applying eye drops.

2. If the affected eye has excessive secretions, first clean the eye and eyelashes with a cotton swab (from the inner corner of the eye to the outer corner).

3. Tilt your head back, use the left index finger to hold the lower eyelid downward, exposing the lower conjunctival sac. Hold the eye drop with the right hand, using the back of the left hand as a pivot. Apply one drop of eye solution is sufficient. If unsure whether the drop has entered the eye, apply another drop. For ointment, squeeze a small strip of ointment from the inner corner to the outer corner of the lower conjunctival sac. Then rotate the bottle to separate the ointment. Be careful not to let the bottle tip touch the eyelashes or eyelids to avoid contamination.

4. After applying eye drops, gently close your eyes for 5-10 seconds to allow the medication to spread evenly across the eyeball. At the same time, gently press the inner corner of the eye for about 5-10 seconds to close the tear duct, preventing the eye solution from flowing through the nasal tear duct to the nasal mucosa, which may cause discomfort and prevent absorption into the body.

5. If using both eye drops and eye ointment, apply the eye drops first, wait 5 minutes, and then apply the eye ointment.
