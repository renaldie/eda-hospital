## Seizure Precautions

1. When a seizure occurs, lay the patient flat on their back with their head turned to one side to prevent vomit from blocking the airway. If the patient's teeth are clenched and bleeding occurs from biting the tongue, do not forcibly pry open their mouth.

2. Do not restrain the patient's limbs or attempt to stop their convulsions. Guide the patient to sit or lie down to prevent head injuries, and move them away from potential dangers to avoid fractures or other injuries.

3. Observe and record the time of onset, symptoms, activities the patient was engaged in during the seizure, and the duration of the seizure. This information will help the physician make a diagnosis and provide treatment; seek immediate medical attention.

4. Patients with a history of seizures should take medication as prescribed by their doctor. Avoid infections, fever, and additional stimuli such as intense light or sound. Do not consume alcohol, maintain a balanced diet, and ensure adequate sleep. Attend regular outpatient follow-ups for monitoring and control.
