## Precautions for Constipation

1. Maintain a balanced diet, consume more fruits and vegetables, avoid spicy foods, alcohol, and coffee. If there are no restrictions, drink at least eight large glasses of water daily.

2. Increase daily activities and exercise.

3. Establish a regular toilet routine. The best time for bowel movements is 15-20 minutes after breakfast. Do not hold back when feeling the urge to defecate. Ensure sufficient time for bowel movements and avoid excessive straining while using the toilet.

4. Do not self-medicate with laxatives or enemas without a doctor's instructions. Please return for follow-up visits.

5. Abdominal massage (clockwise direction) can promote intestinal peristalsis.
