## Post-Surgical Wound Care Instructions

1. Swelling at the wound site may continue for 8-12 hours after injury. Elevate the injured area and apply ice packs.

(1) Place an appropriate amount of ice cubes in the ice bag and add water to one-third of the bag's capacity.

(2) Invert the ice bag to check for leaks. Wrap the ice bag with a dry towel and apply it to the affected area.

(3) Apply ice four times daily, each session lasting 15-20 minutes with rest intervals in between.

2. Keep the wound dressing clean and dry. Avoid contact with water. If the dressing becomes damp, replace the gauze and medication immediately. When showering, use a protective bag to cover the injured limb until the physician permits water contact.

3. If the wound is located on a joint, reduce movement to prevent the wound from reopening.

4. For facial or head wounds, use the prescribed ointment provided by the physician and take medication as directed by the prescription.

5. Two days after wound suturing, visit the outpatient surgery clinic for a follow-up. The physician will determine the suture removal date based on the wound's condition.

6. If the wound shows signs of infection such as redness, swelling, pain, discharge, fever, or abnormal pain, high fever, chills, swelling leading to numbness, pallor, poor blood circulation, or pus discharge, seek medical attention immediately.
