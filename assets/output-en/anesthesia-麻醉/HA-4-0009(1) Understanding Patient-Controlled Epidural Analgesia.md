## What is Epidural Patient Controlled Analgesia

An anesthesiologist temporarily places a catheter into the epidural space in the patient's back, then connects a machine to the catheter. The machine controls the continuous administration of analgesic medication, allowing the medication to enter the epidural space through the catheter. This locally blocks the nerves that transmit pain signals, achieving pain relief. When the patient feels pain, they can press the control button to supplement medication.

This is an advanced medication delivery machine. When you feel pain, you can press the medication button yourself, and the machine will inject analgesic medication, providing rapid pain relief within approximately 10-15 minutes.

## Applicable Scope of Epidural Patient Controlled Analgesia

Severe postoperative wound pain from thoracic and abdominal surgeries, pain relief during childbirth, and cancer pain.

## Common Side Effects

Possible side effects include: nausea, vomiting, bloating, dizziness, skin itching, difficulty urinating, and drowsiness. Due to the presence of local anesthetics, some patients may experience numbness or weakness in their limbs. This condition is not permanent and will return to normal after the medication is metabolized.

If you experience any of the above, please inform the nursing staff in the ward to contact the pain management nurse for handling.

## How to Use Patient Controlled Analgesia

Currently, the National Health Insurance does not cover patient-controlled analgesia, so it must be paid for out-of-pocket, and refunds are not available. If you need this service, please inform the pre-anesthesia assessment clinic or the nursing staff in the ward about your intention to use it.
