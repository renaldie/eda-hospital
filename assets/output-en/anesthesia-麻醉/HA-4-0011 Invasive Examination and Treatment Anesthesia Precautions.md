## Pre-Anesthesia Information Sheet for Invasive Examinations and Treatments

The process for invasive examination and treatment anesthesia is as follows:

1. If the anesthesia assessment has been completed, please arrive 30 minutes earlier on the day of the examination for pre-examination preparation. If the anesthesia assessment has not been completed, please arrive one hour earlier than the scheduled check-in time and complete the assessment at the third-floor Anesthesia Evaluation Clinic.

2. On the day of the examination, fast (remain empty-stomached) for at least 8 hours before the examination, avoiding solid food or oily meals; for light meals or dairy products, fast for 6 hours; for breast milk, fast for 4 hours; for clear fluids (plain water, clear tea), fasting for more than 2 hours is sufficient. Do not take hypoglycemic medications on the day of the examination. For hypertension medications, if the examination is in the morning, take them before 6:00 AM on the day of the examination; if the examination is in the afternoon, take them before 9:00 AM on the day of the examination.

3. If you have removable dentures, nail polish, or contact lenses, please remove them first.

4. On the day of the examination, please have one family member accompany you. The patient should not drive home alone to ensure safety. If there is no family member to accompany you, the examination and treatment anesthesia cannot be performed due to safety concerns after medication. We appreciate your understanding.

5. For outpatient patients, the anesthesia fee is paid before the examination; for inpatient patients, the fee is paid upon discharge.
