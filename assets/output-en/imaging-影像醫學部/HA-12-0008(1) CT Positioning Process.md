## CT Positioning Process

CT positioning machines can scan the three-dimensional anatomical structure of the human body, providing images required for radiotherapy. At the same time, in the CT positioning room, molds to fix the body will be made to assist in daily posture fixation during subsequent radiotherapy. Before undergoing CT positioning, please remove any metal objects on your body. Patients who require contrast agent injection should fast for four hours before the injection. Before positioning, the nurse will first help you insert an IV catheter. After the catheter is inserted, please wait in the waiting area for a while.

After entering the CT positioning room, the radiologist will guide you to cooperate with the CT positioning. If you experience any physical discomfort (such as pain, coughing, or sputum production), please immediately inform the radiologist.

Depending on the treatment area, different treatment postures will be required, and the posture for each treatment will be the same. Therefore, if you feel uncomfortable when the radiologist helps you into position, please immediately inform the radiologist to assist in adjusting the posture.

When making the fixation mold, you may feel a warm and moist sensation with a certain degree of tightness. This level of tightness is necessary to help fix your position during each treatment. (The example image shows a head fixation mold; different molds will be made depending on the treatment area.) After the fixation mold cools down, before the CT scan, the nurse will inject the contrast agent. The contrast agent itself is warm, so it is normal to feel a warm sensation after injection. After positioning is completed, if you do not feel any discomfort, you can ask the nurse to remove the IV catheter (the removal site is where the needle was inserted). If there are no other fasting requirements for examinations, drinking more water can help expel the contrast agent from your body. The subsequent treatment time will be notified by phone.

## Notes

The radiologist will draw black lines and markings on your body, which are used for positioning and posture correction before radiotherapy, not the treatment position. Please be careful when bathing! You can rinse with clean water, but do not use soap to scrub or wipe vigorously. If the black line markings fade, do not redraw them yourself. Wait until the treatment time and let the radiologist handle it.
