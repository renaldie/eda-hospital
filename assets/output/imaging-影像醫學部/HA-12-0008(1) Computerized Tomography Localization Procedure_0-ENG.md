## CT Localization Procedure

The CT localization machine can scan the three-dimensional anatomical structure of the human body, providing images needed for radiation therapy. At the same time, molds to fix the body are made in the CT room to assist in daily posture fixation during subsequent radiation therapy. Please remove any metal objects from your body before undergoing CT localization. Patients who need contrast agent injection should fast for four hours before the injection. Before localization, the nurse will first insert an intravenous catheter for you. After the catheter is placed, please wait in the waiting area.

After entering the CT localization room, the radiotherapist will guide you to cooperate with the CT localization procedure. If you feel unwell (such as pain, coughing, or sputum), please inform the radiotherapist immediately.

Different treatment sites require different treatment postures, and the posture is the same for each treatment session. Therefore, if you feel uncomfortable when the radiotherapist positions you, please inform the radiotherapist immediately to assist in adjusting your posture.

When making the fixation mold, you will feel a wet and warm sensation and a certain tightness when wearing it. This tightness is necessary to help fix your position during each treatment session (the example picture shows a head fixation mold; different molds will be made depending on the treatment site).
