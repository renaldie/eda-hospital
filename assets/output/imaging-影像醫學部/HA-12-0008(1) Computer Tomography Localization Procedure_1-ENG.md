After the fixed mold has cooled, before scanning the CT images, the nurse will come to inject the contrast agent. The contrast agent itself is warm, so it is normal to feel a warm sensation after it is injected into the body. After positioning is completed, if there is no discomfort in the body, you can ask the nurse to remove the needle (the needle removal site is the same place where the injection was given). If there are no other examinations requiring fasting, you can drink more water to help eliminate the contrast agent from the body. The time for subsequent treatment will be notified by phone.

## Precautions

The radiologist will draw black lines and marks on the body, which are used by the radiologist for positioning and posture correction before radiotherapy, not for the treatment location. Be careful when bathing! You can rinse with clean water, but do not use soap to scrub or rub hard. If the black line markings disappear, do not redraw them yourself; wait until treatment to have the radiologist handle it.
