## What is Epidural Patient Controlled Analgesia

An anesthesiologist temporarily places a catheter in the patient's epidural space on the back, then connects a machine to the catheter. The machine continuously administers pain medication, allowing the anesthetic pain medication to enter the epidural space through the catheter, locally blocking the nerves that transmit pain signals, thereby achieving pain relief. When the patient feels pain, they can press the control button themselves to supplement the medication.

This is an advanced medication machine. When you feel pain, you can press the medication button yourself, and the machine will inject pain medication, which can quickly relieve pain in about 10-15 minutes.

## Applicable Scope of Epidural Patient Controlled Analgesia

Severe wound pain after thoracic or abdominal surgery, pain relief during labor, cancer pain, etc.

## Common Side Effects

Possible side effects include: nausea, vomiting, abdominal bloating, dizziness, skin itching, difficulty urinating, drowsiness, and sleepiness. Because it contains local anesthetics, some patients may experience numbness or weakness in the limbs. This condition is not permanent and can return to normal after the medication's effect wears off.

If you experience any of the above, please inform the ward nursing staff to contact the pain care nurse for assistance.

## How to Use Patient Controlled Analgesia

Currently, health insurance does not cover patient controlled analgesia; it must be paid for out-of-pocket and cannot be reimbursed. If you need it, you can inform the pre-anesthesia assessment clinic or ward nursing staff of your intention to use it.
