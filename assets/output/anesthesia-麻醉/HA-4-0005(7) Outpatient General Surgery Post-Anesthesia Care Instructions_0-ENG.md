# Outpatient General Anesthesia Postoperative Precautions

## Project Introduction

General anesthesia is a method using drugs to induce a sleep-like, unconscious state during surgery or examination, leaving no memory of the entire procedure.

## Process Description

This anesthesia method allows the patient to be pain-free and unaware during surgery (or examination). After surgery (or examination), the patient is observed in the anesthesia recovery room and only discharged home once stable.

## Precautions After Returning Home

☐ Activity: Within 24 hours after surgery or examination with anesthesia sedation, do not drive, ride, or operate motorcycles (or bicycles), do not make important decisions, do not engage in dangerous work, and try to rest at home. If going out is necessary, be accompanied by a healthy adult.

☐ Diet: If there is no nausea or vomiting after returning home, start with water or liquid diet. If no nausea or vomiting occurs, resume normal diet.

☐ Pain: Pain at the surgical site is normal and can be managed with painkillers prescribed by the doctor.

☐ Nausea and Vomiting: Mild nausea and vomiting may occur after surgery or examination.

## Seek Immediate Medical Attention If You Experience:

(1) Heavy bleeding at the surgical site.

(2) Chills or fever (body temperature exceeding $38^{\circ}C$).

(3) Chest pain: sharp stabbing pain or difficulty breathing.

(4) Persistent nausea and vomiting.

(5) Pain that cannot be relieved.

※ Special Reminder for Gynecological Patients: ☐ Gauze removal time: Month Day Hour.

If no special symptoms occur, please visit the hospital at the scheduled appointment time.
