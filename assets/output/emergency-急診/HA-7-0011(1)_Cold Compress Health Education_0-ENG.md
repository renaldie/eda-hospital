## Ice Pack Education

1. For trauma or inflamed wounds, follow the instructions of medical personnel.

2. Take an appropriate amount of ice cubes and place them in an ice pack, adding water to one-third of the bag.

3. Turn the ice pack upside down to check for leaks, then wrap the ice pack with a dry towel and apply it to the affected area.

4. Apply ice packs four times a day, each time for 15-20 minutes with rest intervals.
