## Precautions for Acute Gastroenteritis

1. During the acute phase, reduce or temporarily stop eating. If thirsty during fasting, moisten lips with water or suck on ice cubes.

2. If using anti-diarrheal medication, it can be temporarily stopped when diarrhea is not continuous.

3. Avoid dehydration; pay attention to water and electrolyte replenishment. You can drink sports drinks diluted with water at a 1:1 ratio.

4. Try to avoid milk and soy products, greasy foods, and irritating foods.

5. After symptoms improve, try giving plain boiled water. If there is no discomfort, gradually provide small amounts of light foods (such as porridge, rice water, white toast, juice).

6. If vomiting recurs, rest for a few hours before eating again.

7. Prevention methods: wash hands frequently, pay attention to cooking environment, and emphasize food hygiene.

8. Mild diarrhea can be managed at home with rest. If vomiting persists, diarrhea continues, dehydration shock occurs, pain shifts to the lower right abdomen, or high fever develops, please return for medical consultation promptly.
