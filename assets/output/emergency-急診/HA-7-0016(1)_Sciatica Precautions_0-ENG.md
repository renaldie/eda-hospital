## Sciatica Precautions

1. Try to avoid lifting heavy objects, intense waist exercises, and bending over.

2. Maintain proper sitting and standing posture, and avoid wearing high-heeled shoes.

3. Rest in bed as much as possible when experiencing pain.

4. Do not sleep on spring mattresses or foam beds; sleep on a hard board bed.

5. Eat more fruits and vegetables to prevent constipation.

6. You can wear an abdominal binder or back brace to protect the waist.

7. Return to orthopedic or neurosurgery outpatient clinics for consultation.

8. If there is progressive paralysis, urinary incontinence or inability to urinate, or severe abdominal pain, please go to the emergency room.
