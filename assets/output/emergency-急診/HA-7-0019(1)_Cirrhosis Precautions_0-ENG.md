## Precautions for Liver Cirrhosis

1. Follow instructions to consume a high-carbohydrate, high-protein diet (e.g., fish, meat, eggs, milk); however, if hepatic coma occurs, protein intake should be restricted.

2. For those with esophageal varices, avoid coarse, hard, or overly hot foods; chew thoroughly and eat slowly.

3. For those with ascites and edema, adopt a low-salt diet and restrict fluid intake.

4. Eat small, frequent meals; maintain a regular lifestyle; get adequate rest; avoid strenuous exercise; quit smoking and alcohol.

5. Prevent infections; watch for signs of bleeding (skin bruising, gum bleeding, black stools); and regularly return to the hospital for follow-up.

6. Avoid straining during bowel movements; eat more vegetables and fruits to prevent constipation.

7. If experiencing massive vomiting of blood, bloody stools, deep jaundice, coma, abdominal pain with fever, seek medical attention promptly.
