## Constipation Precautions

1. Maintain a balanced diet, consume more fruits and vegetables, avoid spicy foods, alcohol, and coffee. If there are no restrictions, drink at least eight large glasses of water daily.

2. Increase daily activity and exercise.

3. Use the toilet regularly; the best time is 15-20 minutes after breakfast. Do not hold in the urge to defecate, ensure sufficient time for toileting, and avoid excessive straining.

4. Do not use laxatives or enemas without a doctor's instruction. Please return for follow-up visits.

5. Abdominal massage (clockwise direction) can promote intestinal peristalsis.
