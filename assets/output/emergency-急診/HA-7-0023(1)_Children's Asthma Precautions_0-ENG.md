## Precautions for Children with Asthma

1. To prevent attacks, please follow the doctor's instructions for medication and avoid contact with allergens.

2. Wear a mask and scarf when there is a large temperature difference; during cold and flu season, avoid public places; engage in appropriate exercise, maintain a balanced and mild diet; carry medication at all times for emergencies. Avoid any asthma triggers such as cigarettes, smoke, pollen, cold air, dust, and dust mites.

3. If there is persistent high fever, coughing with a large amount of yellow phlegm, difficulty breathing, or if inhaler medication does not effectively relieve symptoms, seek medical attention promptly.
