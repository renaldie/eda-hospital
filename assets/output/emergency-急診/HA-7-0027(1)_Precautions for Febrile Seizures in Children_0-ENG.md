## Precautions for Febrile Seizures in Children

### 1. Causes of Febrile Seizures:

When a child has a fever, convulsions may occur in the whole body or in localized limbs, often accompanied by temporary loss of consciousness; this is called a febrile seizure. It usually occurs within the first 24 hours of the fever onset, mostly happens only once, stops within a few minutes, the child wakes up shortly afterward, and there are no subsequent paralysis or mental confusion symptoms. Fortunately, febrile seizures rarely occur after the age of five.

### 2. How to Handle Febrile Seizures?

Since simple febrile seizures rarely pose immediate danger and do not cause neurological sequelae, it is important to stay calm. First, lay the child flat on a safe bed or floor where they will not slip. Measure the body temperature and use a rectal suppository to reduce the fever. If vomiting occurs, turn the head to the side and clear the vomit to keep the airway open. If there is no obvious tongue biting, do not place any objects in the mouth to prevent tongue biting, as this may cause choking or induce vomiting. Monitor breathing and heartbeat for normalcy. If convulsions continue for several minutes, seek immediate medical attention. For children who have awakened, closely observe for signs of impaired consciousness, persistent vomiting, severe headache, neck stiffness and pain, persistent high fever, or signs of limb paralysis.
