## Precautions for Patients with Difficulty Breathing and Their Families

1. Difficulty breathing is one of the signs of many heart, lung, and respiratory diseases. If there are symptoms of difficulty breathing, both the patient and their family should pay close attention and monitor any changes closely. Regardless of whether there is a known history of heart or lung disease, it should not be taken lightly.

2. Patients with chronic diseases should take medications regularly as prescribed by their physician. If the condition changes, they should visit the relevant outpatient department for further follow-up and examination within a few days or seek medical attention immediately.

3. When experiencing difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, or cyanosis, have the patient sit up first, prohibit feeding, and do not allow them to get out of bed or move around freely. Oxygen or emergency medications may be given according to the physician’s instructions to relieve symptoms, and immediate medical attention should be sought.

4. After treatment and discharge from this hospital, if patients with difficulty breathing develop symptoms such as persistent high fever, chest pain, cold sweats, cyanosis, inability to lie flat and sleep, or lower limb edema, please go directly to the emergency room for assistance.
