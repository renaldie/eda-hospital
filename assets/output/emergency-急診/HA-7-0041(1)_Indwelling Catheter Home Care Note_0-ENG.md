## Home Care Instructions for Indwelling Catheter

1. Catheters are made of general materials and silicone materials. They should be placed and replaced according to medical orders and fixed for the specified time to avoid infection. Regular follow-up at the urology outpatient clinic is required.

2. Clean the perineal area twice daily with soapy water and change the catheter fixation site daily.

3. Drink plenty of water to increase urine output. Daily urine volume should be maintained at least 1500cc.

4. Avoid pressure and twisting on the catheter, and frequently squeeze the catheter to prevent blockage.

5. The urine bag should be kept lower than the patient's waist to prevent urine backflow and infection. Empty the urine bag when it is more than 2/3 full.

6. If there are signs of urinary tract infection such as fever, chills, urethral pain, or hematuria, seek medical attention immediately. Eat foods rich in vitamin C (such as oranges, tangerines, tomatoes, and papayas) to help prevent urinary tract infections.

7. Be careful to prevent the patient from removing the catheter by themselves to avoid urethral injury.
