## Precautions for Children's Abdominal Pain

1. Abdominal pain in the following situations should be treated promptly: sudden severe abdominal pain, when pressing the abdomen causes the child to cry more intensely; a lump appears on the side of the child's genital area; persistent abdominal pain with increased pain in the lower right abdomen when pressed; continuous nausea and vomiting, abdominal muscle tension, or abdominal muscles becoming as hard as a board; nausea, vomiting, and bloody stools.

2. Take medication on time as directed by the doctor; eat small, frequent meals with a gentle diet (avoid stimulating or fried foods).

3. If vomiting or severe abdominal pain occurs, temporarily avoid eating or drinking until symptoms improve and the doctor permits eating a light diet.
