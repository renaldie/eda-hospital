## Precautions for Children with Fever

1. Get plenty of bed rest and drink plenty of fluids such as water, fruit juice, glucose water, or glucose electrolyte solution.

2. Do not wear too many clothes or cover with too thick a quilt; if clothes become wet, change them immediately.

3. Maintain a normal indoor temperature and take medication regularly as directed by the doctor.

4. Measure body temperature every 4 hours; if ear temperature is above 39°C and there is no chills, use an ice pillow or take a warm bath (water temperature 30–34°C) to reduce the temperature. If there is no chills, an ice pillow can be used; if ear temperature is above 38°C, oral antipyretics can be given according to medical advice; if ear temperature is above 38.5°C, suppositories can be given as directed by the doctor, with intervals of 4-6 hours between doses (suppositories should be refrigerated to prevent melting).

5. Stay calm during fever, observe the child's mental alertness, and if necessary, call to ask whether an emergency visit is needed; follow up at the outpatient clinic.

6. If there is persistent high fever, headache, neck stiffness, difficulty breathing, large amounts of yellow phlegm, poor appetite, drowsiness, poor activity, or almost no food intake, please return to the clinic promptly.
