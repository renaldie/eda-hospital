## Precautions After Surgical Wound Suturing

1. The wound will continue to swell 8 to 12 hours after injury. Elevate the injured area and apply ice.

(1) Place an appropriate amount of ice cubes in an ice bag and fill one-third with water.

(2) Turn the ice bag upside down to check for leaks, wrap the ice bag with a dry towel, and apply to the injured area.

(3) Apply ice four times a day, each time for 15 to 20 minutes with breaks.

2. Keep the wound dressing clean and dry. The wound should not come into contact with water. If the dressing becomes wet, immediately replace the gauze and change the medication. When showering, cover the injured limb with a protective bag until the doctor permits water contact.

3. If the laceration is near a joint, reduce movement to prevent the wound from reopening.

4. For facial and head wounds, use ointments prescribed by the doctor and take medications on time as directed.

5. Two days after suturing, visit the surgical outpatient clinic for a follow-up. The doctor will decide the date for suture removal based on the wound condition.

6. If signs of infection appear, such as redness, swelling, pain, discharge, fever, or other inflammatory symptoms, or if there is abnormal pain, high fever with chills, swelling causing numbness, pale color indicating poor blood circulation, or pus discharge, seek medical attention promptly.
