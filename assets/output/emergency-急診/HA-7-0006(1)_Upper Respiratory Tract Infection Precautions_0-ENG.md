## Precautions for Upper Respiratory Tract Infection

1. Intermittent fever lasting 3 to 5 days is common and a normal process. Please take medication as prescribed and drink plenty of warm boiled water; if the ear temperature exceeds 38°C without chills, an ice pillow can be used, and if it exceeds 38.5°C, a warm bath is recommended.

2. When coughing severely, drink more warm boiled water and avoid cold, sweet drinks and citrus fruits; if there is phlegm, use abdominal muscles and deep breathing to help cough it out; wear a mask when going out to avoid irritation from cold air.

3. Ensure adequate rest and consume plenty of vegetables and fruits.

4. Stay calm during fever, and if necessary, call to inquire whether an emergency visit is needed; also have regular outpatient follow-ups (Emergency hotline: 615-0995).

5. If there is persistent high fever, headache with neck stiffness, difficulty breathing, large amounts of yellow phlegm, or inability to swallow saliva, please return to the emergency department for treatment.
