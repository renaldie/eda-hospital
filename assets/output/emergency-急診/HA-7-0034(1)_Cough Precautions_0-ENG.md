## Cough Precautions

1. When your throat itches, hold warm boiled water in your mouth and swallow slowly to avoid coughing.

2. Avoid eating ice, sweet foods or drinks, and temporarily avoid citrus fruits (oranges, tangerines, grapefruits, lemons).

3. Avoid cold air irritation; wear a mask or scarf if necessary; avoid smoking and dust irritation.

4. If you have phlegm, take deep breaths to cough it out (press your abdomen with your hand or lie down and hug your knees).

5. Do not drink water or eat anything within half an hour after taking cough syrup.

6. During coughing, wear a mask to prevent spreading to others.

7. Take medication as directed by your doctor and follow up for outpatient treatment.

8. If you have persistent high fever, asthma, large amounts of yellow phlegm, severe dry cough, coughing up blood, or cyanosis, seek medical attention promptly.

9. If you have high fever, cough, or diarrhea, and have traveled abroad or had close contact with suspected SARS patients, you may be infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome. If symptoms do not improve or worsen after seeking medical care, please return to the hospital promptly for treatment.
