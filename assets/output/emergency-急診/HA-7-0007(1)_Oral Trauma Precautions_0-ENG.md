## ☐ Extraoral Trauma Precautions

1. Rinse your mouth with warm salt water or mouthwash after each meal to keep the oral cavity clean.

2. For oral sutured wounds, stitches generally do not need to be removed. However, if the suture ends remain or there is a foreign body sensation after 10 days, please visit the oral surgery outpatient clinic for treatment.

3. Depending on individual circumstances, consume liquid or soft foods (such as juice, milk, porridge), and avoid rough, irritating, or hot foods.

4. If signs of wound infection appear, such as redness, swelling, pain, discharge, fever, or other inflammatory symptoms, or if there is abnormal pain, high fever, or chills, please return for a follow-up visit promptly.

5. Please return to the outpatient clinic for scheduled follow-up.
