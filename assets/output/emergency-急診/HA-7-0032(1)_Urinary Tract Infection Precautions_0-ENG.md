## Urinary Tract Infection Precautions

1. Drink plenty of water. If there are no contraindications, drink at least 2000ml of water daily.

2. Do not hold in urine and keep the perineal area clean. Women should wipe from front to back after urinating; urinate immediately after sexual intercourse, drink plenty of water, and change sanitary pads frequently during menstruation.

3. Eat more foods containing vitamin C, such as oranges, tangerines, tomatoes, and papayas.

4. Take showers and avoid wearing tight synthetic fiber underwear, tights, and shapewear.

5. If you experience high fever with chills and flank pain, seek medical attention promptly.

6. Hematuria (blood in urine) is a common symptom of cystitis and should be treated at the clinic.
