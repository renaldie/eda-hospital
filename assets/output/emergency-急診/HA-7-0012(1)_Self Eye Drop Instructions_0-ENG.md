## Instructions for Self-Administering Eye Medication

1. Wash both hands thoroughly before and after applying eye medication.

2. If there is excessive eye discharge, first clean the eyes and eyelashes with a cotton swab (from the inner corner of the eye to the outer corner).

3. Tilt your head back, use the index finger of your left hand to pull down the lower eyelid to expose the lower conjunctival sac. Hold the eye drops with your right hand, using the back of your left hand as a support point, and apply one drop of eye drops, which is sufficient. If unsure whether the drop has entered the eye, you may apply one more drop. For ointment, squeeze a small strip from the inner corner to the outer corner into the lower conjunctival sac, then rotate the bottle to break off the ointment. Be careful not to let the bottle tip touch the eyelashes or eyelid to avoid contamination.

4. After applying the medication, gently close your eyes for 5 to 10 seconds to allow the medication to spread evenly over the eyeball. At the same time, gently press the inner corner of the eye for about 5 to 10 seconds to close the tear duct, preventing the medication from flowing into the nasal mucosa via the nasolacrimal duct, which can cause discomfort and systemic absorption.

5. If using both eye drops and eye ointment, apply the eye drops first, wait 5 minutes, then apply the eye ointment.
