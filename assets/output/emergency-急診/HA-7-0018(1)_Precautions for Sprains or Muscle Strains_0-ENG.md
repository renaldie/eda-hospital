## Precautions for Sprains or Muscle Strains

1. Rest more, avoid further activity, and reduce the risk of re-injury.

2. The pain is usually the worst 2 to 3 days after the injury. During this time, apply ice to the injured area, continuing this step for 24 to 48 hours.

(1) Put a small amount of ice cubes into an ice bag and add water to one-third full.

(2) Turn the ice bag upside down to check for leaks, wrap the ice bag with a dry towel, and apply it to the injured area.

(3) Apply ice four times a day, each time for 15 to 20 minutes, then rest.

3. Try to elevate the injured limb, wear properly fitting shoes (high heels are prohibited), and avoid massage.

4. If the pain is unbearable, or if swelling and bruising continue to increase after treatment, return for medical consultation.
