## 1. What is Acute Myocardial Infarction?

When the blood vessels supplying the heart become narrowed or blocked, the myocardium cannot receive enough oxygen and nutrients. At this time, the heart muscle undergoes necrosis and hypoxia, which affects heart function and myocardial cells, and in severe cases, threatens the patient's life. Therefore, when a myocardial infarction occurs, it is crucial to restore blood flow in the shortest possible time to minimize myocardial hypoxic injury.

## 2. Common Symptoms of Myocardial Infarction:

1. Pressure-like, constrictive pain under the sternum, a heavy sensation, burning, or an indescribable discomfort. Persistent chest pain may last 30 minutes or longer, usually not relieved by nitroglycerin (NTG) or rest, with no specific onset time. Severe cases may experience difficulty breathing, loss of consciousness, arrhythmia, blood pressure drop, or even shock.

2. Pain may radiate to the arms, shoulders, neck, jaw, or back, often accompanied by weakness, sweating, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, indigestion, and abdominal bloating.

3. Fever may occur 24-48 hours after myocardial infarction.

## 3. Risk Factors:

### 1. Age:

The incidence of ischemic heart disease increases with age.

### 2. Gender:

Men—The incidence of ischemic heart disease rapidly increases after about 45 years old.

Women—The incidence gradually increases after 55 years old or after menopause.

### 3. Family History:

If one parent has had a myocardial infarction, the risk of myocardial infarction in their children increases.

### 4. High Cholesterol:

The more cholesterol in the blood, the thicker the buildup on the vessel walls, causing plaque formation, leading to arteriosclerosis and narrowing of the vessel lumen, which easily causes vessel blockage. The incidence of ischemic heart disease is directly proportional to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) levels and inversely proportional to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) levels.

### 5. Hypertension:

Elevated blood pressure more easily damages the stability of vascular endothelial cells, allowing cholesterol to enter the vessel walls and form arteriosclerosis and blockage.

### 6. Diabetes:

Increases oxidative stress on coronary arteries and insulin resistance. In a high blood sugar environment, plaques more easily accumulate in vessels. Diabetes doubles the risk of ischemic heart disease.

### 7. Overweight or Obesity:

Overweight or obesity can cause elevated blood pressure, high blood lipids, and diabetes, which in turn induce ischemic heart disease.

### 8. Lack of Exercise (Sedentary Lifestyle):

Lack of exercise doubles the risk of ischemic heart disease and worsens other risk factors.

### 9. Unbalanced Diet:

A diet high in saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol-rich foods easily triggers ischemic heart disease.

## 4. Types and Methods of Treatment:

### 1. Coronary Artery Balloon Angioplasty:

Using a cardiac catheter inserted from the femoral artery (or radial artery), a balloon is placed at the site of coronary artery narrowing and inflated to open the blockage and increase blood flow. Additionally, a coronary artery stent can be delivered via catheter to the narrowed site for better results.

### 2. Thrombus Aspiration Surgery:

During emergency cardiac catheterization, if a large thrombus is found, thrombus aspiration surgery can be performed to remove the clot, preventing distal microvascular embolism and subsequent myocardial perfusion insufficiency, further reducing the area of myocardial necrosis.

### 3. Coronary Artery Stent Placement:

During balloon angioplasty, the physician may place a balloon catheter carrying a metal stent at the narrowed vessel site to prevent re-occlusion. Stents include bare metal stents and drug-eluting stents.

### 4. Surgical Treatment—Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery:

When coronary artery blockage is severe and unsuitable for balloon angioplasty or stent placement, surgical intervention with coronary artery bypass grafting is required to resolve myocardial ischemia and prevent sudden death caused by myocardial infarction.

### 5. Drug Treatment:

Drug therapy can improve heart function, reduce attacks, and alleviate symptoms but cannot restore narrowed vessels. Various drugs are used to increase oxygen supply or reduce oxygen demand, such as nitrates, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and antiplatelet drugs.

## 5. Precautions for Cardiac Catheterization

1. Before Cardiac Catheterization:

(1) Physiological Assessment:

Blood tests, electrocardiogram, X-ray examination.

(2) Consent Form:

Must include consent and signatures from the patient and family.

(3) Skin Preparation:

To reduce infection risk during surgery, it is generally recommended to shave the arm, upper third of the thigh, and bilateral groin areas.

(Common catheterization sites are the wrist or groin.)

(4) Fasting:

No fasting required for emergency examinations. For examinations the next morning, fast after midnight (including water and food). For afternoon examinations, breakfast is allowed before 7 AM, then fasting (including water and food) afterward.

(5) On the day of examination, remove all metal accessories and removable dentures; remove nail polish or lipstick. Wear patient gown without underwear.

(6) Medical History:

Inform the physician in advance of allergies (especially to contrast agents), bleeding disorders, etc.

(7) Pulse Check:

Nurses will check blood pressure and pulse and mark pulse points on both feet to compare before and after pulse strength changes.

(8) Empty bladder before examination.

2. During Cardiac Catheterization:

(1) Local disinfection and anesthesia are applied. A special catheter is inserted via the blood vessel in the arm or groin and guided to the heart.

(2) The patient remains awake during the procedure and may be asked to cough forcefully to promote coronary artery blood flow.

(3) Injection of contrast agent may cause transient whole-body warmth, nausea, or vomiting; these sensations will quickly subside.

(4) If discomfort such as chest tightness, chills, fever, palpitations, or difficulty breathing occurs, inform medical staff immediately.

3. After Cardiac Catheterization:

(1) After returning to the ward, closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate every 15 minutes for 1 hour, then every 30 minutes for 3 hours.

(2) If the puncture site is the wrist, medical staff will use a hemostatic pressure band or gauze and wide tape to compress the puncture site. Partial removal of the tape starts after 4 hours, with complete removal the next morning. The limb should not exert force, and heavy lifting should be avoided for 1 week.

(3) If the puncture site is the groin and the catheter has been removed in the catheterization room, staff will apply direct pressure with a compression device for 30 minutes, then place a 2 kg sandbag for 4 hours. The puncture site must not bend, and the sandbag must remain in place. After sandbag removal, lie flat for 4-6 hours to prevent bleeding. Afterward, semi-recumbent position is allowed, monitoring for bleeding.

(4) If the catheter is still in place after femoral artery examination, the patient must lie flat before removal. After removal, sandbag compression for 4 hours and lying flat for 6 hours are required. The buttocks may move side to side, but the affected limb joints must remain straight and not bend or exert force. Ankle movement is allowed. Vital signs and circulation and temperature of upper and lower limbs will be regularly assessed.

(5) After returning to the ward, complete bed rest for 4 hours is required. Use a bedpan or urinal if needed. Inform nursing staff if no urination occurs within 6 hours. If the groin wound causes difficulty defecating, inform medical staff to prevent bleeding.

(6) If nausea, vomiting, palpitations, difficulty breathing, chest pain, fever, bleeding, or abnormal sensations such as coldness, pallor, numbness, pain, swelling, bruising, or wetness and pain at the wound site occur, notify medical staff immediately.

(7) Unless contraindicated, normal diet can be resumed after returning to the ward.

(8) The next morning, nurses will remove dressings, disinfect the wound, and cover it with gauze and waterproof film. If no discomfort, gauze can be removed the next day. Bruising near the wound should be reported to the physician. Bruising usually fades within 2-3 weeks.

## 6. Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation Instructions and Precautions

### Phase 1: ICU and General Ward Rehabilitation

1. On the first day after cardiac catheterization: practice deep breathing exercises, gradually raise the head of the bed, sit up, and under supervision, sit at the bedside and perform non-resistance limb exercises.

2. From the second day onward: continue first-day exercises, and under supervision, stand up, march in place, and perform light resistance limb exercises.

1. Day 1:

If no chest pain or discomfort, slowly walk up to 10 minutes, three times daily.

2. Day 2:

If no chest pain or discomfort, climb half a flight of stairs up and one flight down.

3. Day 3 and beyond:

If no chest pain or discomfort, climb one flight of stairs up and down.

During this phase, patients can sit up to eat, wash, change clothes, read, and perform other sedentary activities.

### Phase 2: Outpatient Rehabilitation

Recommended for at least six weeks post-discharge, three times per week. Physical therapists will develop rehabilitation plans based on patient goals, including:

1. Warm-up exercises

- Light resistance training

- Limb activities

- Perceived exertion scale <8

2. Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation exercises

- Treadmill, bicycle, hand cycle, or other prescribed activities

- Perceived exertion scale ≤13

3. Cool-down exercises

- Light cool-down exercises

- Flexibility exercises

- Perceived exertion scale <8

During the process, physical therapists monitor vital signs to ensure safety. Rehabilitation is not allowed if resting blood pressure is <90/50 or >160/90 mmHg, or heart rate is <50 or >100 bpm.

Light housework such as sweeping, mopping, and cooking is allowed. Sexual activity is permitted with physician approval.

### Phase 3: Community and Home Rehabilitation

Patients without chest pain or discomfort should develop regular exercise habits near home, community centers, schools, or gyms, such as brisk walking, jogging, cycling, swimming, dancing, or Tai Chi, at least three times per week, 30 minutes or more each time.

### Outpatient Rehabilitation Precautions:

1. Eat normally before exercise; avoid exercising within one hour after meals.

2. Wear appropriate light sportswear: sports clothes, shoes, and bring a towel.

3. Drink adequate water after exercise; bring your own eco-friendly cup.

4. Avoid nail polish or heavy makeup to prevent interference with vital sign monitoring.

5. Inform therapists if taking medications controlling blood pressure or heart rate or if medication was missed.

6. Inform therapists immediately if chest tightness, chest pain, dizziness, cold sweat, or chills occur during exercise.

7. Inform therapists if experiencing difficulty breathing or perceived exertion reaches 13 on the scale.

## 8. Nutritional Care Instructions

1. Choose fresh ingredients; avoid canned and processed pickled foods and avoid consuming their juices or sauces.

2. Be aware of foods with hidden high sodium content, such as noodles, preserved fruits, and biscuits. Reduce use of additives like alkali, baking soda, baking powder, or salt.

3. Prefer home cooking and reduce eating out. Use natural spices like vinegar, scallions, ginger, garlic, star anise, lemon juice instead of condiments like soy sauce paste, ketchup, or MSG.

4. Limit high-cholesterol foods such as offal, crab roe, and fish eggs. Those with high triglycerides should avoid high-fat and high-sugar foods like French fries, fried dough sticks, cakes, Chinese pastries, chocolate, and ice cream.

5. Choose whole grains and unrefined foods like sweet potatoes, brown rice, and pumpkin instead of white rice. Avoid refined sugars such as fruit juices, soft drinks, candies, or pastries.

6. Prioritize unprocessed soy products (soy milk, tofu, dried tofu), fish, and eggs as quality protein sources; reduce red meat intake. Consume deep-sea fish like salmon, mackerel, and cod 1-2 times per week for omega-3 fatty acids that help reduce vascular inflammation.

7. Eat fresh vegetables (2 bowls) and fruits (2 bowls) daily to supplement natural antioxidants (polyphenols, vitamins, isoflavones, carotenoids) to enhance vascular antioxidant capacity.

8. Avoid fried foods. When eating braised meat or stews, refrigerate and remove the top layer of fat before consumption.

9. Use plant oils such as camellia oil, soybean salad oil, and olive oil for cooking; avoid artificial or animal fats.

10. Quit smoking and alcohol.

## 9. Home Care Instructions and Lifestyle Modifications

Eliminate risk factors such as controlling hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, quitting smoking, and weight loss. Appropriate exercise is the cheapest and most effective way to prevent this type of heart disease.

1. Within one week after returning home, avoid strenuous exercise and activities involving excessive bending of the hip or knee joints, such as mountain climbing, rapid stair climbing, or heavy lifting.

2. If pain, swelling, persistent bleeding, or bruising occurs at the wound site after discharge, return to the hospital immediately for follow-up.

3. Take medications regularly. The main purpose is to prevent re-occlusion or spasm of blood vessels. If you experience medication discomfort, discuss with your doctor for adjustment. Do not stop medication on your own.

4. Regular follow-up visits are necessary because some patients may experience recurrent chest pain, possibly due to re-occlusion, which often occurs within six months after surgery.

5. If any discomfort occurs, especially chest tightness, difficulty breathing, or palpitations, inform your doctor during follow-up. Seek medical attention early if necessary.
