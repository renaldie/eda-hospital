# Ophthalmology Pupil Dilation Examination Education

## 1. Definition of Pupil Dilation:

Apply pupil dilation eye drops to paralyze the ciliary muscle of the eye, enlarging the pupil. This allows for more detailed examinations of cataracts, the fundus (vitreous body, macula of the retina, and optic nerve), and children's vision tests.

However, depending on individual conditions, a few people may need to apply the drops 2-3 times to achieve the dilation effect.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align: center;'>Children</td><td style='text-align: center;'>For children under 16 years old, because the ciliary muscle contraction ability is stronger, to achieve better dilation, apply the drops once every 10 minutes, for a total of 3 times.</td></tr></table>

## 3. Precautions After Pupil Dilation:

1. After the pupil is dilated, there may be temporary blurred vision, difficulty reading, and light sensitivity. Therefore, do not drive or ride a motorcycle on the same day to avoid danger.

2. Vision generally returns to normal about 4 to 6 hours after dilation. A few patients may take 6 to 12 hours to recover. Please be careful when walking or going up and down stairs to avoid falling.

3. You may bring your own sun protection tools such as sunglasses, hats, or umbrellas to reduce discomfort from light sensitivity.
