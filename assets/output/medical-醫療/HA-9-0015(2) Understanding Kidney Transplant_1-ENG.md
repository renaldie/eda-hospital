## Preoperative Clinical Evaluation Process for Patients Waiting for Kidney Transplantation

## 1. What is Kidney Transplantation?

Kidney transplantation refers to the surgical procedure of transplanting a functioning kidney (usually donated by the family of a brain-dead patient with consent, a healthy relative within five degrees of kinship, or a spouse) into the recipient to replace the non-functioning kidney and perform the necessary metabolic functions.

## 2. Who is Suitable for Kidney Transplant Surgery?

Most patients with end-stage renal failure (uremia) who require hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis to sustain life are generally suitable for kidney transplantation, unless the patient has other contraindications such as malignant tumors, systemic infections, severe cardiovascular diseases, coagulation disorders, chronic respiratory failure, heart failure, psychiatric disorders, severe congenital urinary tract malformations, AIDS, etc. However, evaluation by nephrologists and urologists is still required.

## 3. What is the Success Rate of Kidney Transplant Surgery? What Are the Risks and Complications?

The success rate of the surgery depends on the source of the donor: for kidneys donated by healthy relatives, the one-year graft survival rate is over 98%; for kidneys donated by brain-dead donors without kinship, the success rate is about 80-90%. The risks and complications of kidney transplant surgery are similar to those of other surgeries. Most complications can be treated with medication, and only a few severe complications require invasive treatment.

## 4. Can Relatives Donate Kidneys to Each Other?

Waiting for a kidney is a matter of chance. According to the Organ Transplant Act, living kidney donation is limited to transplantation to a spouse or blood relatives within five degrees of kinship. The advantages of relative transplantation include shortening the recipient’s waiting time, the donor’s stable health condition, and sufficient time for donor evaluation. Kidney transplantation from relatives has a higher success rate, so more patients are currently receiving kidney transplants from relatives. The conditions for living kidney donors are:

1. Healthy adults aged between 20 and 70 years.

2. Both kidneys functioning normally.

3. No chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, tuberculosis, no history of tumors, or highly infectious diseases (e.g., AIDS).

4. Voluntary donation with a pure motive.

## 5. If I Donate a Kidney, What Impact Will It Have on My Health? What Examinations Are Required Before Donation?

Under normal circumstances, after donating one kidney, the remaining kidney can take over all kidney functions without adverse effects on overall physiological function. Before donation, the following examinations are required:

1. Blood typing and tissue matching tests, including mixed lymphocyte culture crossmatch tests.

2. Liver and kidney function tests, urine analysis, and culture tests.

3. Electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, and pelvic ultrasound.

4. Psychiatric and social worker consultations and evaluations.

## 6. Is There a Cost for Living Kidney Transplant Surgery? Does National Health Insurance Cover It? How Long After Surgery Can the Donor Be Discharged? How Long Until Normal Life Can Resume?

Currently, National Health Insurance covers the preoperative evaluation and surgery for living kidney transplantation, so no out-of-pocket payment is required except for partial costs (such as extra room or meal fees). Donors are generally discharged 5-7 days after surgery. If there are no complications, with proper wound care and regular follow-up visits after discharge, daily life will not be affected.

## 7. Post-Transplant Care

Kidney transplant surgery involves removing the donor’s kidney and implanting it into the recipient’s lower left or right abdomen. The blood vessels of the new kidney are connected to the recipient’s vessels, and the ureter is connected to the recipient’s bladder. The original kidneys are not removed. The surgery takes about 4-5 hours. Hospitalization lasts about 2 weeks. During hospitalization, transplant surgeons, specialized nurses, and ward nursing staff assist you in adapting to postoperative physical changes, understanding symptoms of rejection and infection, and help you learn self-monitoring and home care. Organ transplant coordinators, clinical pharmacists, and nutritionists also visit to help you understand anti-rejection medications.
