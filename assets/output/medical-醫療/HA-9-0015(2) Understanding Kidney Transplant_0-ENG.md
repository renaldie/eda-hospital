Overall, kidney transplantation not only frees patients from the suffering of dialysis treatment, reduces dietary restrictions, extends life, but also allows for a normal quality of life. Since patients must take anti-rejection drugs for life after surgery, a professional and careful evaluation should be conducted before deciding to accept kidney transplantation. After surgery, close cooperation and follow-up with the transplant team are necessary to avoid rejection of the transplanted kidney and the side effects of anti-rejection drugs.
