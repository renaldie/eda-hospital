# Intermittent Clean Self-Catheterization

## 1. What is Intermittent Clean Self-Catheterization?

The patient catheterizes themselves approximately every 3-4 hours or after using the toilet to empty the residual urine in the bladder.

## 2. Purpose of Catheterization:

1. To regularly empty the bladder to prevent over-distension.

2. To measure the amount of residual urine left in the bladder after each urination.

3. To drain the residual urine from the bladder to avoid infection caused by excessive residual urine.

## 3. Preparation Materials:

☐ Size 12 or 14 catheter (☐ Male ☐ Female)

☐ About 200 c.c. of povidone-iodine solution

☐ Lubricant

☐ Soap

☐ Measuring cup (or container to collect urine)

☐ Desktop standing rotatable makeup mirror (see Figure 1)

## 4. Steps for Intermittent Clean Self-Catheterization:

1. Use neutral soap and clean water to wash the penis and urethral opening for males, or the vulva and urethra for females.

2. If assisted by another person, male patients should lie supine (flat on back), female patients should lie supine with knees bent; for self-catheterization, a semi-sitting position is recommended.

3. The operator should wash hands with soap or hand sanitizer.

4. Remove the catheter from its protective outer tube, apply lubricant, and prepare the measuring cup.

5. Insert the catheter into the urethral opening (females can use a mirror to locate the correct position; insertion depth for males is about 20-25 cm, for females about 5-10 cm).

6. Allow urine to drain into the container; gently press the suprapubic area to help empty the bladder, then remove the catheter.

7. Rinse the catheter with clean water, drain it, then place it in disinfectant solution and tighten the bottle cap.

## 5. Precautions:

1. Self-catheter disinfection method: The catheter has a special outer tube that can hold water-soluble povidone-iodine; replace once a week to maintain sterilization.

2. Catheterization frequency: Self-catheterize after using the toilet, about 3-4 times during the day, once before sleep and once upon waking; adjust based on urine volume or follow doctor's instructions.

3. Monitor changes in urine; if urine becomes red, cloudy, or has an odor change, consult healthcare personnel.

4. The self-catheter can be reused; if the smooth material is damaged or the catheter outlet is blocked, replace immediately.
