## 5. Surgical Treatment for Peripheral Artery Occlusion in the Lower Limbs

When medication cannot control the condition, doctors may recommend surgery to restore blood vessel patency. Surgery can be divided into two types:

1. Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty: (commonly known as balloon angioplasty) In this treatment, the doctor will puncture the skin at the groin or hand to perform the procedure. A catheter is inserted into the blood vessel, passed through the narrowed area, and inflated to expand the vessel, widening it and improving blood flow. The doctor will assess your blood vessel condition to decide whether a stent is needed to support the vessel. This surgery is performed under local anesthesia and has a quick recovery time.

2. Vascular Bypass Surgery: When the blood vessel blockage is too severe, it is necessary to replace the blocked vessel with your own blood vessel or an artificial blood vessel. This is the approach used in such cases.
