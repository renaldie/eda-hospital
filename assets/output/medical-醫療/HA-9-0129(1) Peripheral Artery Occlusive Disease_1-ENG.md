## 1. What is Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease?

Your blood vessels develop arteriosclerosis, causing the vessels to narrow, become blocked, and blood flow to be impeded.

Plaque reduces blood supply

Plaque completely blocks the blood vessel

## 2. What symptoms does Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease cause?

Exercise or climbing stairs can cause progressive muscle pain in the buttocks, thighs, or calves. As the disease worsens, symptoms progress from cold feet and numbness to intermittent claudication, and eventually to chronic non-healing wounds and tissue necrosis.

## 3. What tests are needed to determine if you have Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease?

1. Doppler blood flow test: Used to check the degree of arterial blood flow in the feet, providing a preliminary assessment of arterial narrowing or blockage.

2. Peripheral vascular ultrasound: An advanced color Doppler vascular ultrasound used to gain a deeper understanding of peripheral vascular conditions and serve as a basis for treatment.

3. Computed tomography angiography (CTA): A diagnostic tool combining X-rays and computer imaging. The examination takes about 15–20 minutes and can precisely display the blood vessels in the area.

4. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): A relatively new and accurate test that can clearly show the location of vascular blockages.

## 4. Precautions

1. No smoking (including secondhand smoke): Smoking is the greatest risk factor because nicotine causes arteriosclerosis, accelerates vascular spasms, and inhibits the formation of collateral circulation. Therefore, it must be absolutely avoided.

2. Treat diabetes and keep blood sugar within the ideal range.

3. Improve high blood lipid levels.

4. Control blood pressure.

5. Improve other systemic diseases such as coronary artery heart disease and cerebrovascular disease.

6. If BMI (weight ÷ height in meters squared) exceeds 25, weight loss is necessary.

7. Improve anemia and blood viscosity.

8. Pay attention to foot care, especially for diabetic patients. Wear appropriate shoes to avoid injury or wound infection.

9. Moderate exercise: Can increase collateral circulation.
