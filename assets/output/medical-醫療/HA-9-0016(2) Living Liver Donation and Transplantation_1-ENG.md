## Introduction to Living Liver Donor Surgery

The first living liver donor surgery was performed nearly thirty years ago. According to the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the one-year survival rate after liver transplantation reaches 93%, and the five-year survival rate reaches 75%. Liver transplantation is a primary life-saving treatment when the liver suffers irreversible damage, but there is a severe shortage of liver donors. Therefore, living liver donation provides patients with another option.
