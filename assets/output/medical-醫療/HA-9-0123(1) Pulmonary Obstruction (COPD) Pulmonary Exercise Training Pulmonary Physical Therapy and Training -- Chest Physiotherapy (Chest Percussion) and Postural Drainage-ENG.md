## Pulmonary Obstruction (COPD) Pulmonary Exercise Training

## Pulmonary Physical Therapy and Training—Percussion (Chest Clapping) & Postural Drainage

## What is Pulmonary Obstruction?

Chronic inflammation of the airways, an irreversible obstructive disease

Eighth leading cause of death in Taiwan

## Symptoms: Cough

Phlegm

Shortness of breath

## Risk Factors:

Smoking or secondhand smoke

Harmful environmental substances

Occupational exposure

Family history

Other lung conditions

## Importance of Chest Physical Therapy

1. Chronic inflammation of the airways and excessive secretion of phlegm can block the airways, possibly preventing the lungs from effectively clearing phlegm and affecting ventilation and gas exchange.

2. Using common physical methods and techniques can increase airway phlegm clearance, increase ventilation to improve gas exchange, and prevent or slow the worsening of respiratory diseases.

3. Percussion (chest clapping) uses chest wall tapping to loosen phlegm secreted inside the lungs, allowing it to flow from the lungs through the trachea and be expelled by coughing; combined with postural drainage, the effect is better.

4. Postural drainage uses gravity and changes in body position to place areas with more phlegm in a higher position, combined with percussion to drain phlegm to larger airways for expulsion by coughing.

## Timing for Percussion

One hour before meals or two hours after meals

To reduce coughing up phlegm during full stomach which may cause vomiting and aspiration pneumonia

Percussion Methods and Tools

Commonly use hollow hand cup shape, percussion cups, percussion sticks, etc., tapping at a speed of 3 to 5 times per second

Recommended 3-5 minutes per area, performed 3 times daily

## Precautions

Avoid percussion over drainage tubes or surgical wounds; when percussing the back, avoid shoulders (scapula), spine, kidneys; when percussing the front chest, avoid sternum, clavicles, and other organs or areas

Stop percussion immediately if cyanosis, difficulty breathing, vital sign changes, or coughing up blood occur
