## Diet for Hyperlipidemia

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1240_336_1601_691.jpg" alt="Image" width="21%" /></div>## Hyperlipidemia

Hyperlipidemia refers to increased cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood. Abnormal lipid levels (hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, or both) accelerate atherosclerosis, increasing the risk of stroke, angina, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular disease.

## $^{*}$ Adult Lipid Standards

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_279_553_360_642.jpg" alt="Image" width="4%" /></div>

| Type of Lipid | General Adults (mg/dL) | Cardiovascular or Diabetes Patients (mg/dL) |
|---------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Total Cholesterol (TLC) | < 200 | < 160 |
| Triglycerides (TG) | < 150 | < 150 |
| High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C) | Male > 40, Female > 50 | Male > 40, Female > 50 |
| Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) | < 130 | < 100 |

## $^{*}$ Dietary Recommendations for Hypercholesterolemia

1. Maintain a healthy body weight.

2. Limit intake of foods high in cholesterol, such as internal organs (brain, liver, kidneys), crab roe, shrimp roe, fish roe, etc. It is recommended to consume a variety of proteins and avoid relying solely on meat or legumes. Prefer plant-based proteins to replace some animal-based proteins, such as tofu and bean curd.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_893_0_1011_129.jpg" alt="Image" width="7%" /></div>

3. Limit intake of foods high in saturated and trans fats.

**Saturated fats: Animal foods such as fatty meats, butter, lard, tallow; plant foods such as toasted coconut oil, palm oil.**

**Trans fats: Processed pastries made with hydrogenated fats (cakes, pastries, cookies, etc.).**

4. Use plant oils rich in monounsaturated fats for cooking, such as peanut oil, rapeseed oil, and olive oil.

5. Practice low-fat cooking methods such as steaming, boiling, roasting, stewing, braising, stir-frying, grilling, or cold-pressing. Reduce consumption of meat skin (pork skin, duck skin, chicken skin, fish skin), which are high in fat.

6. Choose fiber-rich foods such as various vegetables and fruits, unprocessed legumes, and whole grains.

7. Moderately consume foods rich in natural antioxidants (such as polyphenols, vitamin C, carotenoids, isoflavones), such as vegetables and green tea, to enhance vascular antioxidant function.

8. Limit alcohol consumption.

9. Adjust lifestyle habits: quit smoking, engage in moderate physical activity, and manage stress.

## $^{*}$ Diet for Hypertriglyceridemia

1. Maintain a healthy body weight, which helps reduce triglyceride levels.

2. Limit intake of refined sweets, fruit juices, beverages, candies, pastries, and other sugar-added products. Instead, consume complex carbohydrates such as root and stem vegetables.

3. Avoid alcohol and alcoholic beverages.

4. Avoid high-fat and high-sugar foods such as fried chicken, french fries, oil cakes, cashews, peanuts, seeds, cakes, Chinese pastries, chocolate, and ice cream.

5. Increase intake of fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, sardines, and tuna.

6. Other recommendations follow those for hypercholesterolemia.
