General Principles

You should consume various nutrients from different food groups in balance each day to meet your body's needs and develop healthy eating habits—avoiding picky eating or overeating.

**Group 1: Dairy (1 cup, 240 ml)**

【My Plate Mnemonic: One cup of milk in the morning and evening】

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_430_153_510_254.jpg" alt="Image" width="6%" /></div>

| Nutrient Components | Calcium, high-quality protein, fats, and various vitamins |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Food Sources        | Fresh milk, unsweetened yogurt, unsweetened kefir         |
| Tip                 | Most Chinese people do not get enough calcium. It is recommended to consume one serving of dairy products in the morning and evening. For those aiming to control calorie intake, choose low-fat or fat-free milk and its products. |

**Group 2: Fruits (2–4 servings per day)**

【My Plate Mnemonic: A fist-sized portion of fruit per meal】

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_422_448_503_532.jpg" alt="Image" width="6%" /></div>

| Nutrient Components | Carbohydrates, dietary fiber, vitamins, and phytochemicals |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Food Sources        | Various fresh fruits                                   |
| Tip                 | Fruits contain carbohydrates and should be consumed in moderation. Dried fruits and fruit juices have higher sugar content and are prone to overconsumption. It is recommended to prioritize fresh fruits and choose seasonal varieties for variety. |

**Group 3: Vegetables (3–5 servings per day)**

【My Plate Mnemonic: Vegetables should be a bit more than fruits】

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_415_721_489_799.jpg" alt="Image" width="6%" /></div>

| Nutrient Components | Dietary fiber, vitamins, phytochemicals, and minerals |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Food Sources        | Leafy greens, flower vegetables, root vegetables, legumes, mushrooms, seaweeds, etc. |
| Tip                 | High in dietary fiber, low in calories, and helps promote satiety and intestinal motility. Pickled and preserved vegetables have high sodium content and contain more additives; fresh or frozen vegetables are better choices. |

**Group 4: Whole Grains and Cereals (1.5–4 bowls per day)**
