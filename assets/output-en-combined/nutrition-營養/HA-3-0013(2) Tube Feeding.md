1. Before feeding, aspirate with an empty syringe to check the digestive condition. If the aspirate volume exceeds 200 mL, feeding should be paused until the patient's aspiration volume improves.

After each feeding, flush the tube with 30–50 mL of warm water to keep the tube patent and prevent food residue.

During feeding, elevate the patient's head and neck by 30–45 degrees. The patient can only be laid flat one hour after feeding, otherwise the food may reflux into the respiratory tract and cause aspiration pneumonia.

If the formula is stored in the refrigerator, it should be warmed to room temperature by water bath before feeding.

3. If adverse reactions such as diarrhea, abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting, or constipation occur after feeding, please report to medical or nursing staff or a dietitian for appropriate management or adjustment.
