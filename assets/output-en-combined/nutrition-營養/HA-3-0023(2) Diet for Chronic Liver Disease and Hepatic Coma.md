(3) Hepatic encephalopathy with coma:

① Immediate diagnosis and removal of the underlying cause; active pharmacological treatment is superior to inappropriate protein restriction.

② Recommended protein intake: 0.6–0.8 grams per kilogram of dry body weight; ensure adequate caloric intake, increasing carbohydrate and lipid sources for energy; after recovery of consciousness, gradually return to a balanced diet of 1–1.2 grams per kilogram of dry body weight.

③ Avoid foods high in ammonia (ammonia-producing foods), such as sausages, ham, fish with bones, cheese, peanuts, and foods with tough skin.

① Balanced diet.

② Limit alcohol intake.

(2) Acute:

### 2. Calorie, Protein, and Dietary Principles:

(1) Calories: 30–35 kcal per kilogram of dry body weight.

(2) Protein: 1–1.2 g per kilogram of dry body weight.

① For patients with malnutrition in both calories and protein who are in a stable phase, protein intake should be increased to 1.2–1.5 g per kilogram of dry body weight to achieve positive nitrogen balance.

② Plant-based proteins contain higher levels of branched-chain amino acids and lower levels of methionine and aromatic amino acids, which are beneficial in improving hepatic encephalopathy; they can be consumed in appropriate amounts.

(3) Prefer fresh, natural foods; avoid processed, preserved, or smoked foods.

(4) Ensure adequate fiber intake to prevent constipation.

### 3. Management Principles for Complications of Liver Cirrhosis:

(1) Esophageal varices: choose liquid or soft foods, and avoid hard, large pieces, rough textures, fried, or deep-fried foods.

(2) Ascites/edema:

① Eat small, frequent meals and select high-calorie-density foods or formulas to reduce fluid intake.

② Low-sodium diet: less than 2000 mg per day.

③ Monitor fluid intake and output balance: if hyponatremia is present, daily fluid intake should be controlled at 1000–1500 cc.

④ In cases of severe hyponatremia or persistent condition, daily fluid intake should be set at the patient's daily urine output plus 500–700 cc.
