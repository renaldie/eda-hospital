## (One) Caloric and Protein Recommendations

|  | Before Transplant | Early Post-Transplant | Stable Period |
|---|---|---|---|
| Calories | General patients: 30 kcal/kg; Obese patients: 25 kcal/kg | 30–35 kcal/kg | 30 kcal/kg |
| Protein | 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day | 1.5 g/kg/day | 1–1.2 g/kg/day |

**Early Post-Transplant Period: (Acute phase; the first 3 months after transplantation)**

**Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculation:**

【Weight (kg) ÷ Height (m)²】

**Obesity is defined as BMI > 24.**

**Example:** Consuming 1.5 g of protein per kg per day (e.g., for a 50 kg individual, this would amount to 75 grams of protein per day, approximately 7–8 portions of protein-rich foods).

1 portion of protein food  
(1 portion of protein food = 7 grams of protein)  
= 1 serving of meat (chicken, duck, goose, pork, beef, lamb, or fish, about three finger-width in size)  
= 1 cup (190 ml) of soy milk  
= 1 egg or 2 egg whites  
= 1/2 box of young tofu or 2 traditional block tofu = 2 triangular oil tofu

## (Two) Dietary Guidance During Early Post-Transplant and Stable Period

### A. Pre-Transplant Nutritional Assessment

Nutritional screening and evaluation for patients scheduled for surgery or transplantation should be conducted promptly to treat malnutrition preoperatively, thereby improving intracellular protein status.

### B. Early Post-Transplant Period (Acute Phase; the first 3 months after transplantation)

After surgery, the risk of sarcopenic obesity and metabolic syndrome should be considered. Nutritional rehabilitation should aim to restore whole-body protein and muscle function as early and rapidly as possible. Therefore, during this stage, patients should consume a **high-protein diet** and obtain **sufficient calories**.

## Dietary Principle One

1. Adequate protein intake (1.5 g/kg/day) and caloric intake.

2. Avoid consuming grapefruit (juice) or pomelos (and related products) one hour before and after taking immunosuppressants. Grapefruit juice may cause severe side effects such as muscle spasms and loss of consciousness; pomelos may interfere with drug absorption.

3. Pay attention to food safety and hygiene; avoid raw foods (such as raw salad, raw fish, raw eggs, raw oysters, raw meat, and unsterilized fresh milk). Foods should be thoroughly cooked and boiled before consumption; do not eat leftovers; ensure that eating utensils are cleaned and disinfected before use.

4. Choose fruits with skin and remove the outer skin, or boil fruits before consumption.

5. Avoid consuming supplements and immune-boosting foods (such as ginseng, ginkgo biloba, seaweed, etc.) to prevent triggering rejection reactions.

6. For patients with hyperglycemia (due to steroid or immunosuppressant use), control starch intake appropriately and avoid refined sugars. Prioritize consuming protein-rich foods (such as beans, fish, eggs, and meat) during meals. (Avoid fructose, sucrose, etc.). Replace staple foods with non-refined starches such as whole grains or root vegetables (e.g., pumpkin, sweet potato, brown rice).

7. For patients with hyperkalemia (due to immunosuppressants), reduce intake of high-potassium foods (such as bananas, watermelon, vegetable juice, meat broth, traditional Chinese medicine soups, energy drinks, chicken flavoring, etc.). Boil green vegetables for 2–3 minutes before stir-frying or mixing with oil.

### C. Stable Period

Maintain the function of the transplanted organ through proper nutrition, reduce metabolic issues caused by long-term use of immunosuppressive drugs, and improve quality of life. Maintain good nutritional status to prevent nutrient deficiencies and reduce the occurrence of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and obesity.

## Dietary Principle Two

1. Maintain ideal body weight through appropriate caloric and protein intake, with a balanced diet as the goal.

2. Consume sufficient fruits and vegetables to increase dietary fiber intake, thereby preventing cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome.

3. Use plant-based oils (such as olive oil, canola oil, sunflower oil, and salad oil) as the primary cooking oils, and consume them in moderation. Reduce the use of animal-based oils (such as butter, cream, lard, and tallow).

4. Limit fried, pan-fried, and deep-fried foods; avoid high-fat foods such as animal skin (fish skin, pork skin), fatty meats (five-layer pork, trotters), and processed foods (such as cured meats, sausages, ham).

5. Consume less high-cholesterol foods, such as animal offal, sea urchin, fish roe, crab roe, etc.6. Reduce foods high in saturated fats, such as animal fats (cream, lard, fatty meats, etc.), and processed plant-based oils (plant-based cream, snacks, pastries, bread, etc.).

7. Limit intake of refined sugars (white sugar, fructose, etc.) to prevent the development of high blood glucose and lipid levels.

8. Control seasoning appropriately and avoid excessive salt intake to prevent hypertension and edema.

9. Patients on long-term steroid therapy should appropriately supplement calcium (calcium-rich foods) at a daily intake of 1200–1500 mg.
