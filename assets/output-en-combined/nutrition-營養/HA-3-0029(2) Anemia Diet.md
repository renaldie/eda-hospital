</div>## What is anemia?

Anemia primarily results from the body's inability to produce enough red blood cells, blood loss leading to red blood cell depletion, or the body's own destruction of hemoglobin. Conditions such as cancer, AIDS, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV), and bone marrow diseases are also common causes of anemia.

Healthy red blood cells transport oxygen to all tissues in the body. When red blood cell levels are insufficient, the body fails to receive adequate oxygen to function normally, leading to anemia-related symptoms.

Common symptoms include: fatigue, weakness, dizziness, palpitations, shortness of breath, paleness, difficulty concentrating, irritability, and reduced activity.

## What should you do about anemia?

Do not blindly supplement iron or vitamins—appropriate testing is required to determine the underlying cause of anemia.

A balanced diet provides the essential raw materials for maintaining normal bodily functions. Under balanced dietary conditions, combining food-based nutrient intake can maximize the effectiveness of nutrients and help identify the true cause of anemia, enabling targeted treatment—this is the fundamental approach to improving anemia.

## Dietary principles for anemia

### 1. Adequate protein:

Protein is one of the elements involved in hemoglobin synthesis, so it is essential to consume sufficient high-quality protein. Good sources include milk, fish, chicken, pork, beef, and eggs. According to the latest dietary reference intake for Chinese adults, the recommended protein intake is 1.1 g/kg for adults and 1.2 g/kg for those over 70 years old.

### 2. Adequate iron:

Iron sources include liver, red meat (such as pork and beef), dried fruits (such as black dates and raisins), dark green vegetables, and iron-fortified foods (such as high-iron milk powder). Animal-based iron is more efficiently absorbed by the human body.

<div style="text-align: center;"> $ ^{*} $ Recommended daily iron intake for adults</div>

|  | Male | Female |
|---|---|---|
| 19–50 years old | 10 mg | 15 mg |
| 51 years and older | 10 mg | 10 mg |

### 3. Supplement vitamin C:

Vitamin C enhances iron absorption. Good sources include various fruits and vegetables (such as papaya, kiwi, oranges, bell peppers, cauliflower, bitter gourd, etc.). It is best to take vitamin C supplements after meals.

### 4. Appropriate folate supplementation:

Folate is an essential raw material in hemoglobin synthesis. Sufficient folate intake can prevent megaloblastic anemia.

Sources include liver, yeast, dark green vegetables, legumes, and whole grains.

### 5. Reduce tea or coffee consumption:

Because tannic acid in tea and coffee hinders iron absorption, avoid drinking tea or coffee during meals. Juice can be used as an alternative.
