Common feeding issues and improvement methods in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

(1) Cut vegetables or meat into small, fine pieces and extend cooking time to increase intake.

(2) Food selection principles

a. Vegetables: Choose soft types of gourds (e.g., winter melon, large summer squash) or tender leaves (remove stems, select coarse leaves).

b. Fish, eggs, meat, and soy products: Choose softer fish meat, minced meat, eggs, or soy-based foods.

## Diet for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)1. Adequate caloric intake without excess to reduce respiratory burden

(1) Recommended caloric intake is 25–30 kcal/kg (based on usual body weight); for individuals with lower body weight (BMI < 21), higher caloric and higher protein intake is recommended. For obese individuals, dietary control to reduce weight is advised to improve respiratory muscle function and lower blood carbon dioxide levels.

(2) Caloric intake should be sufficient but not excessive, as excessive calories converted into fat in the body produce large amounts of carbon dioxide, increasing the patient's respiratory burden and potentially leading to respiratory failure.

Body Mass Index (BMI) calculation formula:

【Weight (kg) ÷ Height (m)²】

For individuals with inadequate caloric intake and without other special chronic diseases, high-protein balanced formulas, pulmonary virus-specific formulas, or concentrated formulas may be selected, and further assessment by a physician and nutritionist is recommended.

Protein intake should be adequate to enhance respiratory muscle endurance.

In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), inflammation and steroid medication use accelerate muscle atrophy. Insufficient muscle mass can further impair respiratory muscle function, increasing respiratory burden.

1) For healthy individuals without acute symptoms: 1.0–1.2 g/kg/day; each meal should include at least two portions (one portion ≈ three finger-width size) of high-quality protein foods to ensure sufficient nutrition and promote muscle synthesis. For older adults at risk of malnutrition, protein intake should be increased to 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day. [Sources of high-quality protein foods]

Animal-based protein sources: pork, chicken, fish, eggs, beef, dairy products.

Plant-based protein sources: soy products (tofu, soy milk, bean buns), broad beans, black beans, etc.

One portion of protein food  
(1 portion of protein food = 7 grams of protein)  
= 1 serving of meat (chicken, duck, goose, pork, beef, lamb, or fish, approximately three finger-width size)  
= 1 cup (190 ml) of soy milk  
= 1 egg or 2 egg whites  
= 1/2 box of young tofu or 2 traditional firm tofu blocks  
= 2 triangular fried tofu pieces

(2) For patients with poor appetite or reduced food intake due to illness, encourage them to consume protein-rich foods such as beans, fish, eggs, and meat first during meals.

(3) For patients with comorbidities (e.g., liver or kidney disease requiring protein restriction), further evaluation by a physician and nutritionist is recommended.

3. Maintain adequate fluid intake to avoid difficulty in expectoration and constipation

(1) Recommended daily fluid intake should be at least weight (kg) × 30 ml/kg.

(2) Patients with cardiac disease, edema, or ascites should have fluid intake restricted under physician evaluation.

(3) Fluid intake should be reduced from beverages such as coffee, tea, alcohol, and stimulants.

(4) For patients who consume excessive fluids and thus have reduced food intake, appropriately provide concentrated foods (e.g., soups, concentrated nutritional products) to reduce meal burden.

4. For poor oral condition or difficulty in eating, adjust food texture to increase intake

| Eating problem | Improvement methods |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Loss of appetite, aversion to food | 1. Maintain good oral hygiene. <br> 2. Provide food with appealing color, aroma, and taste. <br> 3. Consume the best quality and quantity of food during the time of peak appetite throughout the day. <br> 4. Eat small, frequent meals. <br> 5. Drink acidic beverages 30 minutes before meals to stimulate appetite. <br> 6. Use tube feeding or forced feeding if necessary. |
| Shortness of breath during eating | 1. Perform postural drainage, percussion, and breathing exercises at least 30 minutes before meals. <br> 2. During meals, place feet flat on the floor, elbows on the table, and lean forward to fully utilize accessory muscles and prevent aspiration. <br> 3. If breathing difficulties occur during eating, pause briefly and switch to mouth breathing until comfortable before resuming eating. |
| Bloating, constipation | 1. Avoid foods that produce gas, such as onions, green peppers, sweet potatoes, and legumes. <br> 2. Avoid mouth breathing and talking while eating to prevent air inhalation. <br> 3. Increase physical activity to promote gastrointestinal motility. <br> 4. Consume liquid and easily digestible foods. <br> 5. Consume appropriate fiber and fruits to prevent constipation. <br> 6. Administer soft stool agents as prescribed by a doctor if necessary. |
