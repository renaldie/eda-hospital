## Three: Dietary principles

(2) Choose food in a balanced manner and avoid picky eating.

(3) Avoid seasonings high in sodium, such as salt, soy sauce, and flavorings.

(4) Avoid foods high in sodium but not easily noticeable, such as noodles, oil noodles, sweet-salty pastries, sweet-salty cookies, black pepper, curry powder, etc.

(9) Use spicy seasonings sparingly, such as chili peppers,

(10) Avoid smoking and drinking alcohol.

(11) When consuming commercially available low-sodium soy sauce, follow the nutritionist's instructions. Due to its high potassium content, it is not suitable for patients with kidney disease.

(12) Restaurants often use high amounts of salt and monosodium glutamate (MSG) in cooking. Therefore, it is best to avoid dining out. If dining out is unavoidable, avoid soups and pickled foods.
