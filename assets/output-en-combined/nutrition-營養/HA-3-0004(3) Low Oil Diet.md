4. Make full use of mild seasonings  
Such as: sugar, vinegar, Sichuan pepper, eight-cornered spice, five-spice powder, galangal, garlic, tomato sauce, or thickening agents, to stimulate appetite.

5. To remove the oil from braised pork or stewed soups, place the food in the refrigerator to cool, then remove the top layer of oil before reheating and consuming.

### 1. Choose natural, unprocessed foods and avoid processed foods  
Examples: cakes, cookies, snacks, meatballs, sweet and spicy (sweet and spicy snacks), blood rice, hot pot seasonings, milk tea (milk powder), milkshakes, ice cream, etc., which often contain hidden fats.

Food selection should be balanced to ensure adequate intake of various nutrients. Include more whole grains, fruits, and skimmed milk powder to compensate for the reduced calories due to fat restriction.

Supplement fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K  
Individuals who follow a low-fat diet for a long time should take appropriate supplements.

When acute conditions such as pancreatitis, cholecystitis, diarrhea, or abnormalities in fat digestion, absorption, transport, and metabolism occur, fasting should be initiated, followed by a gradual transition from clear liquids → liquids → soft foods → regular diet.

</div>## Low-fat diet

A diet in which the daily fat intake is less than 50 grams, and whose nutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, and other substances are sufficient to meet the body's health requirements.

Reduces the burden on the pancreas or intestines, decreases stimulation of the gallbladder, and lowers blood lipid concentration, thereby improving conditions such as pancreatitis, gallstones, gallbladder inflammation, chylothorax, diarrhea, or hyperlipidemia.

## Choose plant-based oils; daily consumption of 2–3 tablespoons

Examples: soybean oil, olive oil, sunflower seed oil, canola oil, corn oil, grape seed oil, sesame oil, etc.

Oils with high unsaturated fat content (over 85%) should not be heated for cooking to reduce the formation of free radicals and carcinogenic substances.

Meat should be lean; any attached fat and skin should be completely removed.

When selecting lean meat, choose according to fat content in descending order: fish (excluding fish belly meat) → chicken, duck → beef, lamb, pork.

Cook using methods such as steaming, boiling, stewing, braising, roasting, marinating, or cold-dressing, without adding oil. Avoid frying or deep-frying.
