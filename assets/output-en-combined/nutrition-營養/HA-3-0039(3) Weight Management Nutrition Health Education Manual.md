☑ After surgery, the stomach can only hold 100 c.c. Initially, if food intake exceeds this capacity, vomiting or discomfort will occur. In such cases, rest and avoid eating.

☑ Solid and liquid foods should be separated by 20–30 minutes to prevent gastric distension and discomfort.

☑ Eating speed: After surgery, eating should be done slowly, with small, frequent meals and thorough chewing to prevent gastric outlet obstruction, vomiting, and other complications.

☑ Adequate fluid intake is essential to prevent dehydration or constipation.

☑ If adverse reactions occur after eating, temporarily return to the previous stage of food (e.g., clear liquids or liquids) for 2–3 days before adjusting again.

☑ Post-surgical diets should increase the proportion of protein (such as beans, fish, meat, and eggs), which can accelerate weight loss and reduce the risk of binge eating.

☑ Cooking methods should primarily include minimal plant oil, steaming, boiling, stewing, braising, roasting, and cold-dressing. Choose fresh, natural foods and avoid processed, refined, or overly oily and salty foods.

◆ Patients undergoing weight-loss surgery are prone to acid reflux. Avoid spicy and sweet foods, and take anti-acid medication as prescribed. If symptoms do not improve, return to the hospital for a follow-up visit.

◆ Patients undergoing weight-loss surgery should avoid concentrated sweets (such as sugar, soda, cakes, and ice cream) to prevent binge eating.

After any surgery, avoid high-fat and sweet, greasy foods to prevent weight gain and physical discomfort.

In the first two weeks, due to reduced food intake, dizziness may occur. During the first month, due to adaptation to new food intake, occasional burping or vomiting may happen. Closely follow dietary guidance from your doctor and nutritionist to alleviate discomfort.

Post-surgery, regular blood tests are required, and comprehensive vitamins and minerals should be supplemented as prescribed. Do not adjust dosage without medical advice.

☑ The most significant weight loss occurs in the first six months after surgery, with reduced effectiveness gradually observed after one year. The gastric pouch is elastic and will gradually expand, leading to increased food intake. Therefore, take advantage of this golden period and strictly follow professional dietary guidance to achieve the ideal body weight as quickly as possible.## Nutritional Supplementation Recommendations

Blood tests for nutritional assessment will be conducted regularly before and after surgery. During weight loss, due to reduced food intake, the body's demand for nutrients increases—approximately 1.5 to 2 times that before surgery. There are many sources for nutritional supplements; choosing high-quality, well-absorbed products is essential to maintaining health. $ ^{*} $ Iron supplements, calcium tablets, and multivitamins should be taken separately by 2–3 hours.

## Management of Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar)

☐ If blood glucose is below 70 mg/dL, consume 15 grams of carbohydrates = 1 serving of carbohydrate food  

● 3 sugar cubes  
● Half a cup (120 mL) of juice or sugary soft drink or beverage  
● 1 teaspoon of sugar or honey  

◇ If blood glucose is below 50 mg/dL, consume 15 grams of carbohydrates = 2 servings of carbohydrate food  

☐ Recheck blood glucose after 15–20 minutes. If the level remains ≤70 mg/dL, consume another 15 grams of carbohydrate food. If the glucose level still does not return to the normal range, seek medical attention immediately.# Clear Liquid Diet - <1>

___ month ___ day,星期___ ~ ___ month ___ day,星期___

● Clear liquid diet refers to food that is completely free of residue, does not stimulate intestinal peristalsis, and is a clear liquid at room temperature.

● During hospitalization: consume approximately 30 c.c every 30 minutes to 1 hour.

After drinking liquid food, avoid lying down immediately. After discharge, try to replenish fluids as much as possible to prevent dehydration.

● For individuals with unstable blood sugar levels, please carry hard candies or sugary drinks with you to prevent hypoglycemia.

## Before Exercise

➢ Supplement appropriate hydration, and consume low-fiber, water-rich, potassium-containing fruits to slowly release carbohydrates. Key points for hydration

➢ For exercises lasting less than one hour (e.g., running), just drink water before, during, and after exercise—no need to deliberately consume sports drinks.

➢ For competitions or high-intensity exercises lasting over one hour, salt supplementation is needed; sports drinks can be consumed in appropriate amounts.

➢ You can prepare your own sports drink to maintain energy and prevent symptoms such as dizziness, dehydration, and cramps during competitions or high-intensity workouts.

➢ Recommended ratio for homemade sports drink: 1 liter of water + 80g sugar + 3.5g salt.

## ★ Breakfast Shops

Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. With a wide variety of breakfast options available, avoid fried and sugary foods.

☐ Foods fried in thickened dough or pastry have high fat content, such as potstickers (2 portions for 1C1P), fried dumplings, xiaolongbao (soup buns), tangbao (soup dumplings), and steamed buns (3 portions for 1C1P), egg pancakes (2C1P). Try to limit consumption to no more than three times per week.

☐ Sandwiches (2C1–2P) and hamburgers should avoid mayonnaise, chocolate sauce, peanut butter, cream cheese, jam.

☐ Traditional rice balls (without oil sticks) 3C1P; yu fan (rice balls) 2C1P.

☐ Fried meats (e.g., fried chicken legs) must be skinless and fat-free to be consumed. Chicken leg (2P), large chicken leg (3–4P).

☐ Processed meat products such as ham, sausages, and bacon contain high fat content—avoid them as much as possible.

☐ Avoid pancakes (4C), oil sticks (6 cm = 1C), salty soybean milk, potato chips, potato fries (10 sticks = 1C), milk tea, spicy and sour soup, corn soup, and soups.

☐ Beverage options include unsweetened soy milk, low-fat fresh milk, black coffee with fresh milk (0.5P).







## ★ Chinese Buffet and Snacks

Chinese buffets and snack shops are among the most commonly visited dining venues in daily life. With a wide variety of food items and free selection options, just remember a few key principles:

☐ Cooking methods should prefer steaming, boiling, roasting, pickling, or cold-salad preparation. For stir-frying and pan-frying, use minimal oil.

◇ Fried meats (e.g., fried chicken legs) must be skinless and fat-free to be consumed. Chicken leg (2P), large chicken leg (3–4P).

☐ Noodles in small bowls (3C), large bowls (4C); one roll of cold noodle or rice noodle (2C).

☐ Processed meat products such as meatballs, ham, sausages, and bacon contain high fat content—avoid them as much as possible.

☐ Choose more leafy greens to increase satiety. Select the top leaves and drain the juice. For better fat reduction, rinse the greens with clear water or hot water. Alternatively, steam greens without meat sauce. Do not soak rice in soup broth. When drinking clear broth, remove the floating oil on top to avoid consuming spicy-sour soup, corn soup, and soups.

☐ Avoid dishes prepared by frying, sweet-and-sour, vinegar-based, stewed rice, dusted with flour, or thickened with sauce.

☐ Avoid instant noodles (3C), pineapple buns (1C1F).

☐ Pickled meats: just steam them—avoid adding soy sauce or pickled vegetables; avoid organ meats and processed products.

☐ Salted chicken: use minimal seasoning, avoid smoked or organ meats.

☐ Grilled meats: use minimal seasoning, avoid organ meats and processed products.

☐ Meat dumplings (3C2P), vegetable dumplings / peanut dumplings (5C), bowl rice cake (2C1P).

☐ Steamed small meat balls (1C0.5P), steamed large meat balls (2C1P).

☐ Pork/beef filled buns (1 piece = 2C1P), leek pancakes (1 piece = 1C1P).

☐ Cabbage oil pancake with egg (3C1P), grab bread (3C).## ★Banquet, dining gatherings

● 1 small bowl of fried rice, sticky rice, stir-fried rice, stir-fried noodles, etc. = 3C

☑ For soup and broth dishes: only eat the ingredients, do not drink the broth

● Avoid fried dishes: deep-fried shrimp, deep-fried eight-treasure balls, deep-fried sweet dumplings, crispy pastries

● Avoid sweets: sweet soup, ice cream, popsicles, sugary drinks

In Taiwan, during festive occasions, people often gather for meals together. Banquets are the most common social events we encounter, and sometimes we are unable to avoid attending them. It is advisable to communicate with a nutritionist in advance to choose appropriate portion sizes and dishes, allowing you to enjoy the banquet while maintaining a healthy weight. The following guidelines are provided as a reference.

1. General principles: First, you must become familiar with the types and portion sizes of food you can consume in each meal, and remember the dietary restrictions. Although it may be difficult to precisely control your intake at a banquet, you should avoid extreme overeating.

2. Foods high in sugar should be watched carefully:

☐ Banquets often offer various juices and carbonated drinks, which contain high levels of sugar. Try to avoid drinking these. Instead, bring your own tea or sugar-free beverages.

Foods prepared with added sugar and oil—such as sweet and sour, tomato sauce, honey sauce, vinegar-based, and salad dressings—have extremely high calorie content. Try to avoid eating them. For salads, season with salt, pepper, and a light oil-vinegar dressing instead.

☐ Choose fresh fruits instead of pudding, cakes, jellies, taro paste, oily pastries, sweet soups, etc. Canned fruits are not recommended unless they are sugar-free.

3. Foods high in fat and calories: Although these do not immediately affect blood sugar levels, they can impact weight control. At banquets, many dishes use animal fats to enhance flavor. People over 50 or those managing their weight should pay special attention.

☐ Nuts such as sesame seeds, almonds, and cashews in cold dishes are primarily composed of fat. If consumed, limit intake to one tablespoon per serving.

☐ Creamy soups are often thickened with cream, monosodium glutamate (MSG), and flour, resulting in high fat content that is difficult to separate. The fat is evenly distributed throughout the soup. To reduce calorie intake, remove the ingredients and avoid drinking the broth.

☐ Dishes with liquid sauces, especially those thickened with starch, contain large amounts of starch and fat, resulting in high calorie content. Drain the liquid before eating.

☐ Processed meat products made from ground meat, such as meatballs, shrimp balls, lion's head, ham, etc., contain high levels of animal fat. Try to eat only small amounts.

☐ Fried foods must be skinless to be consumed. This includes chicken skin, duck skin, fish skin, and fatty meat. If the skin cannot be removed, it is not recommended to eat them.

☐ Foods high in cholesterol—such as internal organs, black fish roe, crab roe—should be avoided by individuals with high blood cholesterol or cardiovascular diseases.

4. Alcohol is an essential part of banquets. It is difficult for most people to abstain completely. However, after surgery, the digestive system is more fragile, and consuming alcoholic beverages may cause gastrointestinal discomfort. It is recommended to substitute alcohol with colored teas, which are gentler on the digestive system.

★ Beer, mixed drinks: 300cc  
★ Red wine, white wine: 120cc  
★ Whisky, brandy: 40cc  
★ Rice wine: 70cc  
★ Sorghum liquor: 30cc  
★ Shaoxing wine: 80cc  

The above alcohol portions exclude one portion of fruit (1F)## ★ Hot Pot Dishes

Hot pot dishes offer a wide variety of ingredients, all prepared by boiling, making them a good choice for dining out during weight-loss journeys. However, there are several points to keep in mind:

**Selection of broth:** Choose lighter broths such as original broth, dried kelp and dried shiitake broth, or vegetable clear broth.

Avoid high-calorie broths such as spicy hot pot, pickled cabbage and pork hot pot, milk hot pot, sukiyaki hot pot, and lamb hot pot.

**Order of cooking:** First, remove the floating oil from the broth. Then cook leafy greens first, remove them once cooked, and then add meat. Avoid adding meat after the greens have been cooked, as the greens will absorb the fat from the broth.

When selecting meat, prioritize freshness, including fish, shellfish, and other seafood. Processed items such as egg buns, goan balls, and hot pot ingredients often contain hidden fatty meats and starches and should be avoided to prevent negative impacts on weight and blood sugar.

Hot pot beverages: 6 servings of 0.5C1P

Use low-fat condiments such as sambal sauce, peanut sauce, or sesame sauce sparingly. Instead, opt for clear soy sauce with white dipping paste, scallions, ginger, garlic, and other seasonings to keep the dish light and reduce sodium intake, which helps maintain blood pressure.

☐ Hot pot broth is delicious, but it also has the highest fat content. If you wish to drink the broth, pour it out at the beginning, or substitute it with unsweetened tea.

## ★ Fast Food

Fast food outlets are commonly found in commercial districts, and many friends often gather here for meals. Most fast food items are fried, high in calories and starch, with limited vegetable portions. However, by following a few simple principles, you can enjoy fast food while staying healthy and happy.

☐ The main dishes in fast food restaurants are typically hamburgers (2–3C), which can be consumed. However, avoid fried meats; instead, choose lean pork slices with lettuce and cheese. Ask the staff to serve a small amount of mayonnaise.

☐ Remove the outer fried skin from chicken pieces (2P) or chicken wings (1P).

☐ Pizza: 12-inch, 1 slice, 2C1P. Pizza is one of the most popular foods among Chinese people. Its main ingredients include flour, oil, cheese, and tomato sauce. It is actually quite high in calories. Regardless of size, consume no more than 3 slices, pair it with vegetables, and choose a lighter flavor.

☐ Pancake: 4C; Crêpe pastry: 2C

☐ Spaghetti: There are three types of sauces—white sauce, red sauce, and green sauce—each of which is high in calories and fat. Choose a stir-fried version such as white wine clams spaghetti (3C1P) or fresh vegetable spaghetti (3C) to reduce gastrointestinal strain.

☐ For beverages, choose zero-calorie cola, lemon water, or coffee. Alternatively, ask the counter to substitute sugar.

Triangle cake: 1C1F, McChicken, fries, baked goods, onion rings, soup, cola, milkshake, apple pie, ice cream, and frozen yogurt—all of these are high in fat and sugar and should be completely avoided.## ★ Western Cuisine

In addition to fast food outlets, various small and large Western restaurants offer diverse dining choices for the local population. During festivals, these restaurants often become highly sought-after. Below are several dining principles to help you enjoy meals without stress or physical burden.

☐ Soups: Western soups are generally divided into clear soups and rich soups. Prefer clear soups over rich ones to reduce caloric intake.

Bread: A small bun (1C) or a French bread with a small amount of condiment can serve as a main food source. Roasted potatoes and roasted corn are also acceptable. However, garlic bread (1C) and baked potatoes (1C) are less suitable.

Salads: Fresh vegetable salads such as small yellow cucumbers, tomatoes, and asparagus are excellent choices. Salad dressings high in oil should be avoided; instead, use oil and vinegar or Japanese soy sauce.

☐ Meat: 1 ounce = 1 portion (1P). Western meat dishes are typically served as plated meals, available in iron-plate or clay-plate styles. Prefer clay-plate meals, as they contain less cream and are best cooked by roasting. Fried dishes such as German pork feet should be consumed sparingly. Use rose salt or sea salt instead of steak sauce. Iron-plate steak with rice absorbs a lot of oil—consume in small portions.

☐ Desserts: After meals, choose fresh fruit or tea jelly. Western desserts such as cheese and cakes should be avoided.

☐ Beverages: Choose unsweetened or low-sugar teas or fresh fruit juice.

## ★ Japanese Cuisine

Japanese cuisine uses fresh ingredients and light cooking methods, which are widely accepted by the local population and are beneficial during weight-loss processes.

☐ Sashimi: 3–4 pieces per portion (1P), typically consisting of fish or seafood seasoned with wasabi and soy sauce. With no added fats, it offers a refreshing taste. However, be cautious about the source of the ingredients to avoid food poisoning.

☐ Sushi:  
- Hand-pressed sushi (3 pieces = 1C = 1P)  
- Small flower sushi (3 pieces = 1C)  
- Large flower sushi (2 pieces = 1C)  
- Small sushi (5 pieces = 1C)

☐ Hand rolls: Using seaweed with various vegetables and no salad sauce is a healthy and good food option.

☐ Fried foods: Fried shrimp (1 piece = 1P) can be consumed by removing the outer crispy skin and dipping in soy sauce. Fried vegetables such as fried eggplant and fried corn笋 contain extremely high oil content and should be avoided.

◇ Grilled foods: Salt-grilled items are preferable. Avoid consuming large amounts of meat that has been marinated with sauces or sugar.

☐ Okonomiyaki (large plate): 3C = 1P; Squid balls (small): 3 pieces = 1C = 1P

☐ Tea bowl steamed rice (1 bowl = 1P) and miso soup have a refreshing taste. However, miso soup has high sodium content, so individuals with unstable blood pressure should consume it with caution.

☐ Rice dishes: When eating curried rice, children's rice bowl, or beef rice bowl, separate the sauce from the rice to reduce the intake of oil from the thickened sauce.

☐ Noodles: For pot noodles, choose udon (3C = 2P), ramen (3C = 2P), or winter noodles (2C = 2P). Noodles such as difficult silk noodles and egg noodles are fried and should be avoided. Ask the restaurant to replace the hot pot ingredients with fresh vegetables or meat slices, pair with a plain broth, and avoid adding doubanjiang (fermented bean paste).<div style="text-align: center;">飲食記錄 FOOD DIARY</div>
