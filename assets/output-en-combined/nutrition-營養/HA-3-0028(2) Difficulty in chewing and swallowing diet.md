## Eight: Key points to consider when eating

**Before eating**

1. Prepare to eat with full concentration—avoid chatting or watching TV.
2. Sit upright with the chin slightly retracted.
3. Use a small spoon (about 3 cm) and eat slowly in small bites.
4. Use a small, shallow cup to control the amount of water consumed.

**During eating**

1. Eat in small bites and swallow completely before taking the next bite.
2. Swallow multiple times to avoid residue.
3. If the throat feels itchy after swallowing, clear it by coughing before swallowing again.
4. If the voice sounds wet or muffled after swallowing, clear the throat and swallow thoroughly.

**After eating**

1. Clean the mouth to maintain hygiene.
2. Maintain a seated position for 20 minutes to prevent food reflux.

# Chewing and Swallowing Difficulty  
# Dietary Adjustment for Swallowing Difficulties (Texture Modification)

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1224_370_1469_760.jpg" alt="Image" width="15%" /></div>## One: What is chewing and swallowing difficulty?

When issues occur during the process of food moving from the mouth to the stomach, resulting in an inability to properly chew food into small pieces or to swallow food smoothly, this is known as "chewing and swallowing difficulty."

## Two: What are the impacts of chewing and swallowing difficulty?

Long-term chewing and swallowing difficulties can lead to reduced appetite and malnutrition. Additionally, food and liquids may accidentally enter the trachea and even the lungs, leading to complications such as aspiration pneumonia.

## Three: Who is prone to chewing and swallowing difficulty?

1. Brain injury → stroke, head trauma, brain tumor.  
2. Neurodegenerative diseases → Parkinson's disease, dementia.  
3. Head and neck cancer → oral cancer, tongue cancer, laryngeal cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer.  
4. Aging and frailty, and other conditions (e.g., pneumonia).

## Four: Basic dietary principles for chewing and swallowing difficulty

1. Avoid foods that are too hard, too sticky, too dry, or too large (e.g., nuts, bread, mochi, fish balls).  
2. Foods that easily break apart in the mouth, have uneven small particles, or change texture in the mouth are also likely to cause choking.  
3. Foods should be moist, soft, and easily cut with simple utensils.  
4. If liquid intake is difficult, thickeners can be used appropriately to increase viscosity and aid swallowing.  
5. Since meal intake may be reduced, it is recommended to increase snacks (small, frequent meals) to meet nutritional needs.
