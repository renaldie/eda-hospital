## Low-residue Diet  

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_677_402_1101_846.jpg" alt="Image" width="35%" /></div>## Low-residue diet

A low-residue diet is defined as a diet that provides no more than 4 grams of dietary fiber per day. Its primary purpose is to reduce residue in the colon. Residue includes undigested plant fibers, animal connective tissues, and byproducts of dairy products after digestion.

A low-residue diet refers to "fine and soft" foods, such as white rice porridge, white noodles, edge-removed toast, skinless chicken and fish meat; foods to avoid include large portions of meat and fish, high-fiber vegetables and fruits, milk, and dairy products. If unsure about whether a particular food is acceptable, one can refer to health education materials provided by medical institutions or search online.

Failure to follow the low-residue and clear liquid diet principles may result in incomplete bowel cleansing, leading to accumulation of fiber, vegetable leaves, seeds, or fecal matter. These cannot be effectively cleared by laxatives alone, which may negatively affect the quality and results of the examination.

## Dietary Principles

1. Base the diet on a balanced intake, avoiding high-fiber foods that leave large amounts of residue in the gastrointestinal tract, allowing the digestive system to rest and aiding in wound healing.

2. A low-residue diet consists of "fine and soft" foods, such as white rice porridge, white noodles, edge-removed toast, skinless chicken and tender fish meat; foods to avoid include large portions of meat and fish, high-fiber vegetables and fruits, milk, and dairy products. Choose tender meats, refined grains, filtered fruit juice, vegetable juice, or cooked soft, low-fiber vegetables and fruits. Avoid stimulant and gas-producing foods such as milk and dairy products, which should be avoided entirely.

3. Foods should be soft in texture, and cooking methods should avoid deep-frying, pan-frying, or long-term pickling.

4. Increase fluid intake appropriately to prevent constipation.

5. Mineral and vitamin supplementation should be considered based on individual circumstances. This diet is only a phase during treatment. Adequate calories and protein should be provided according to the patient's condition, and the intake should gradually be increased to reach normal levels.
