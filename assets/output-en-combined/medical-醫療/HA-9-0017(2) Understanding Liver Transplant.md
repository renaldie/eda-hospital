## V. Preoperative Assessment

Liver transplantation is a high-risk and lengthy surgical procedure, therefore a comprehensive preoperative evaluation is required to assess the patient's tolerance to prolonged surgery, to identify any underlying diseases, and to anticipate potential postoperative complications. The following are the preoperative assessment items:

(1) Blood tests, including blood type, liver and kidney function, tumor markers, arterial blood gas analysis, hepatitis B or C virus load, and testing for opportunistic infections, etc.

(2) Urine tests (including 24-hour urine collection) and stool tests.

(3) Cardiopulmonary function assessment, including electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography, cardiac blood flow scan, chest X-ray, and pulmonary function tests.

(4) Imaging studies, including abdominal ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bone density, and breast ultrasound (for women).

(5) Endoscopic examinations, including gastroscopy and colonoscopy.

(6) Multidisciplinary consultations, including cardiology, pulmonology, anesthesiology, psychiatry, and dentistry.

(7) For patients with liver tumors, additional bone scan is required. For patients with Wilson's disease, blood and urine copper level tests are needed.

(8) Other tests are determined based on individual patient conditions, such as positron emission tomography (PET) scan.

Once the preoperative assessment is completed and the patient's condition is stable, they can return home and await follow-up visits at the outpatient clinic.

## VI. Surgical Procedure for Liver Transplantation

Liver sources can be divided into deceased donors (including brain death or cardiac death) or living donors. For deceased donors, upon receiving notification from the transplant team, patients should follow instructions to fast and proceed to the emergency department for hospitalization. For living donors, surgical scheduling requires approval from the Medical Ethics Committee. The liver surgery typically lasts 8–12 hours. After surgery, patients are transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for approximately 3–5 days of care. Once stable, they are transferred to the transplant ward (single-room, isolated care). The total hospital stay is approximately 14–21 days.

## VII. Postoperative Home Care and Regular Outpatient Follow-up

Postoperative home care and patient and family education begin immediately after transplantation. This includes understanding the phenomenon of rejection, familiarizing oneself with medications, diet, infection prevention, and home care, etc.

Since the transplanted liver is not the patient's own organ, lifelong immunosuppressive medication is required. However, these immunosuppressive drugs also suppress the patient's immune system. Therefore, regular outpatient follow-up is extremely important.

## Understanding Liver Transplantation

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1231_377_1684_691.jpg" alt="Image" width="26%" /></div>## Introduction

The liver is one of the most essential organs in the human body. When it loses function, it gradually progresses toward failure and may eventually require a liver transplant. Thanks to advancements in transplant surgery and the continuous development of anti-rejection medications, post-operative organ rejection and drug side effects have been significantly reduced. As a result, one-year survival rates after liver transplantation have reached 93%, and five-year survival rates have reached 75%. The following is a brief introduction to liver transplantation:

## I. When is liver transplantation required?

When irreversible, progressive liver disease occurs and no other effective treatment options are available, liver transplantation is the only treatment method capable of extending life.

## II. Indications for liver transplantation

(1) Liver cirrhosis caused by viral hepatitis (B hepatitis, C hepatitis).

(2) Primary hepatic malignant tumors in patients whose liver function makes tumor resection surgery unsuitable (according to literature and the Ministry of Health and Welfare guidelines: a single tumor smaller than 6.5 cm, fewer than three metastatic tumors, with no single tumor diameter exceeding 4.5 cm, and a total diameter not exceeding 8 cm).

(3) Acute liver failure due to fulminant hepatitis or drug-induced liver failure.

(4) Wilson's disease (abnormal copper metabolism).

(5) Congenital biliary atresia (common in children in Taiwan).

(6) Primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis:

(1) Primary biliary cholangitis  
(2) Primary sclerosing cholangitis

(7) Other end-stage liver diseases that cannot be treated with conventional therapies.

## III. Contraindications for liver transplantation

(1) Patients with uncontrolled infections.

(2) HIV-positive individuals, but only if the following conditions are met:

(1) CD4 count greater than 200 cells/μl for at least six months.

(2) Adherence to medical advice and stable treatment with antiretroviral therapy, with recent viral load less than 50 copies/ml over the past six months.

(3) No uncontrolled, potentially fatal opportunistic infections or tumors are present.

(4) There remains a future option for antiretroviral therapy.

(3) Patients with untreated tuberculosis.

(4) Patients with malignant tumors (excluding primary liver tumors).

(5) Patients clinically assessed as unable to comply with long-term post-transplant treatment.

(6) Patients with severe cardiovascular or pulmonary dysfunction.

(7) Patients with severe cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular disease, resulting in inability to perform daily activities and who cannot undergo reconstructive surgery.

(8) Patients with immunodeficiency or autoimmune diseases, even after treatment, who have a poor prognosis.

(9) Patients with substance abuse disorders.

(10) Patients with alcohol addiction who have not completed abstinence for more than six months.
