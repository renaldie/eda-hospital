## Section III. Donor Surgery Explanation

The liver has the ability to regenerate. In general, a person only needs 15–20% of a standard liver to meet normal physiological demands. However, when performing a donation surgery, the safety of the living donor is prioritized, so at least 35% of the donor's total liver volume must be retained. The volume of liver donated is determined based on the recipient's body weight, with typical donation volumes ranging from 0.8% to 1% of the recipient's body weight. The specific division of the liver also varies depending on whether the donor is an adult or a child, as well as the recipient's body weight. The details are as follows:

## Section IV. Possible Complications of Liver Donation Surgery

Liver donation is a major surgical procedure. According to literature, the donor mortality rate is between 0.6% and 1%. Possible complications during the surgery include pleural effusion, intra-abdominal infection and peritonitis, bile leakage, intestinal adhesion, and wound infection. The total incidence rate of these complications is approximately 10%. Most of these complications can be cured with medication treatment; only a very small number require further invasive treatments.

## Section V. Postoperative Recovery and Follow-up

The total hospitalization duration after liver donation surgery is approximately 10 days. There will be a brief period of abnormal liver function post-surgery, which typically returns to normal within 2–3 weeks. By six months after surgery, the liver can regenerate to about 90% of its original volume. Patients can resume light work one month after surgery, and can return to heavy-duty work and intense physical activities by three to four months post-surgery. Regular outpatient follow-up visits are still required after discharge.

## Introduction to Living Liver Donation Surgery

The first living liver donation surgery dates back nearly thirty years. According to the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the one-year survival rate after liver transplantation is 93%, and the five-year survival rate is 75%. Liver transplantation is a first-line treatment option for patients with irreversible liver damage. However, due to a severe shortage of liver donor sources, living liver donation provides an alternative option for patients.
