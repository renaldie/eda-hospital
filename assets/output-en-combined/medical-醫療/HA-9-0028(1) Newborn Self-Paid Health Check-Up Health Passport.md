## Tips for Parents:

This examination report only conducts early screening for structural abnormalities. The functions of various systems will gradually mature after birth. Only through regular follow-up visits to the pediatric outpatient department can we ensure your baby's health.

If you have any questions, please contact the pediatric department consultation line: (07) 6150950 or (07) 6150011 ext. 5605## *Cord Blood Allergy Index Test

☐ IGE > 0.9, the baby has a high allergic constitution; please refer to the health education section to reduce the occurrence of allergic diseases.

☐ IGE < 0.9, the baby has a low allergic constitution; if allergic symptoms appear, please visit the pediatric outpatient clinic.

## Doctor's Tip:

In infants under one year old, allergic symptoms most commonly manifest in the skin (atopic dermatitis) and gastrointestinal tract (colic). As the child grows older, respiratory allergic symptoms gradually develop, including asthma and allergic rhinitis. If your baby has any of the above conditions, in addition to referring to the cord blood allergy test results, we still recommend that you visit the pediatric outpatient clinic for further consultation and prevention.

## Infant Hearing Screening (AABR)

☐ Passed; routine pediatric outpatient visits and preventive vaccinations are sufficient; no additional follow-up is required.

☐ Failed; please follow up with an otolaryngology outpatient clinic for further evaluation.

## Doctor's Tips:

Hearing loss varies in severity. Only in cases of severe or profound hearing impairment do families typically notice it. Even mild hearing loss can lead to delayed language development. Therefore, we once again urge parents: infants who fail the hearing screening must be referred to an otolaryngology clinic for follow-up and evaluation. Do not assume that because your child can hear sounds, there is no hearing problem.
