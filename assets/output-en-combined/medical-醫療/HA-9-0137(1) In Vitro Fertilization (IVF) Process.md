|------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Menstrual cycle day 2-3 | Administer ovulation-inducing injection | Stimulate follicle growth; before administering the injection, perform vaginal ultrasound and blood tests (CBC, VDRL, HIV, E2, FSH, LH). Perform pre-egg retrieval checks (1): ECG and X-ray examination. | |
| Days 3-14 | Administer ovulation-inducing injection | Stimulate follicle growth; continuously administer FSH injections for 8-12 days (up to 14 days) to promote follicle development. Store medication in the refrigerator; do not place in the freezer. Follow physician's instructions to return to the hospital for vaginal ultrasound monitoring of follicle maturity, approximately 3-4 times. | Fees vary depending on drug type, formulation, and duration of use |
| Day 15 | Trigger ovulation injection | Promote follicle maturation to achieve optimal egg retrieval timing; return to the hospital to collect the trigger injection (hCG). Ovulation induction is typically performed when follicles reach ≥1.8 cm in diameter. | || 时间 | 流程 | 说明 | 备注 |

| 第17天 | ☑取精 | · 取卵日上午请先生取精。取精后，存放于取精罐中。若取卵当天先生无法配合取精，可事先将精子取出冷冻。冷冻精子和新鲜精子并不会影响胚胎品质和试管婴儿成功几率。 | 精虫冷冻费用及保存费用另计 |
| 第17天 | 取卵 | · 取卵手术采用静脉注射全身麻醉，因此前一晚12点过后须禁食（含水）。<br>· 上午进行取卵手术，手术结束后将在恢复室观察30-60分钟。<br>· 待麻醉科医师评估后，抽完纱布、解过小便后，便可出院返家，不需要住院。 |  |
| 第17天 | 体外受精 | · 中午于实验室进行受精。<br>· 受精可分为体外自然受精(IVF)及单一精虫显微注射(ICSI)两种。一般采用体外自然受精，特殊情况将采用单一精虫显微注射。<br>· 单一精虫显微注射费用以≤5颗计算，之后每增加1颗，再加收费用。 | 单一精虫显微注射费用另计 |
| 第18-22天 | 胚胎培养 | · 顺利的话，第3天一个胚胎会有8个细胞。 |  |
| 第20-22天 | 新鲜胚胎植入或胚胎冷冻 | · 胚胎培养可于第3天或第5天植入，或选择胚胎培养3-5天冷冻保存。<br>· 目前人工生殖法规定胚胎冷冻时间最长为10年。 | 胚胎冷冻费及培养费用另计 |
| 第22-23天 | 胚胎着床前遗传诊断(PGS/PGD) | · 若因医疗目的需要接受着床前遗传诊断(PGD)或着床前染色体筛查(PGS)，于取卵手术后5天进行，胚胎植入将顺延一个周期。 | 着床前遗传诊断费另计(实际需求依病人情况选择) |
| 第34-36天 | 新鲜胚胎植入验孕 |  |  |## E-DA HEALTHCARE GROUP

| Day 13 | • Continue taking estrogen (E2) • Perform vaginal ultrasound | Endometrial thickness and shape should reach optimal implantation timing • Endometrial thickness ≥0.8 cm is suitable for embryo implantation. • The doctor will discuss with the patient to determine the embryo grade for implantation. • The timing of implantation will be decided based on embryo culture days. | |
| From Day 13 onwards | Supplement progesterone | Enhance progesterone function • To stabilize the uterine lining, progesterone supplementation is required for approximately 14-16 days after embryo implantation to support embryo implantation. | |
| Days 16–18 | Embryo implantation | • The embryo will be thawed on the morning of implantation. • The implantation procedure does not require anesthesia and will not cause discomfort after implantation. Patients need to lie flat for 2 hours. | |
| Days 23–25 | Follow-up visit | Remove vaginal progesterone gel • Remove vaginal progesterone gel. | |
| Days 30–32 of menstrual cycle | Pregnancy test | Confirm pregnancy status • Pregnancy test will be conducted 2 weeks after implantation. | |
| Days 37–39 | Follow-up visit | Confirm whether the embryo has implanted in the correct location | |
| Days 44–46 | Follow-up visit | Confirm whether the embryo has a heartbeat | |## E-DA HEALTHCARE GROUP
