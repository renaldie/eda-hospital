# Post-procedure Care after Kidney Biopsy

## I. Definitions

Kidney biopsy is an invasive procedure. The physician uses ultrasound guidance to insert a needle and obtain three small segments of kidney tissue for pathological diagnosis. This helps determine the treatment plan or assess the progression of kidney disease.

## II. Applicable Population

Patients following a kidney biopsy.

## III. Care and Precautions

1. When can you start eating:

One hour after the procedure ends and upon returning to the ward, if vital signs are stable and there is no discomfort, you may begin drinking small amounts of water. If there is no discomfort, you can then gradually resume eating.

2. Sandbag compression and bed rest time:

You must remain in a supine position and not get up. A 2-kilogram sandbag will be applied at the biopsy site to control bleeding for 6 hours. After the sandbag is removed, you must remain flat in bed for an additional 2 hours. During this time, nursing staff will monitor your blood pressure and heart rate according to medical instructions and assess your condition.
