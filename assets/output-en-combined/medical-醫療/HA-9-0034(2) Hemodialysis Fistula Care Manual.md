(Filled by the hospital)## ☑ Contact Information

If there is blockage in the dialysis catheter, poor blood flow, or elevated venous pressure, please contact the following units promptly.

※ Yida Hospital, Cardiology Department - Interventional Cardiology Unit  
Phone: (07) 615-0011, extension 5029

※ Yida Hospital, Cardiac Surgery Department  
Phone: (07) 615-0011, extension 9, transfer to the Chief Physician of Cardiac Surgery

$^{※}$ Dachang Hospital, Cardiology Department - Catheterization Laboratory  
Phone: (07) 559-9123, extension 7509## ☑ Manual Functions

1. Effectively establish a standardized process for recording dialysis procedures to facilitate effective communication among various departments.

2. Establish standardized operating procedures for surgical treatments.

3. Assist dialysis patients in understanding their own conditions and managing their health status.

4. Improve the patient-doctor relationship and enhance the quality of medical care.

## ☑ Usage Timing

1. Issued by the dialysis department at the beginning of dialysis treatment.

2. Carried to the relevant department during any procedures involving dialysis catheter surgery to facilitate the execution of related operations.

3. The relevant surgical departments shall record in detail the surgical procedures (including diagrams) for easy reference.

4. During dialysis, patients should hand over the records to the dialysis department for storage; when transferring to another dialysis center, the records should be handed over to the patient to carry and continue use.## ☑ Important Notes for Patients

1. The puncture site of the dialysis catheter should be kept clean at all times to prevent infection.

2. After performing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), compression hemostasis will continue for 2 hours, and it is recommended that patients remain at the hospital during this time for observation until the catheter hemostasis has improved before leaving.

3. After dialysis, the dialysis catheter should be properly hemostasized, and prolonged compression with a pressure band should be avoided as much as possible.

4. It is recommended to rotate puncture sites during dialysis to extend the lifespan of the catheter.

5. Avoid puncturing at sites with vascular malformations, hard lumps, or bruises.

6. Follow medical instructions and actively perform fist clenching exercises to expand the dialysis catheter in the arms.

7. Avoid sleeping on the side to prevent long-term compression on the catheter.## ● Please seek medical attention or contact the dialysis unit immediately if any of the following situations occur:

1. Abnormal elevation of venous pressure during dialysis, indicating possible narrowing of the dialysis catheter.

2. Swelling in the arm with the dialysis catheter should raise suspicion of central venous obstruction or stenosis.

3. Redness or discharge from the arm with the dialysis catheter should raise suspicion of infection.

4. Coldness, numbness, or pain in the hand.

5. Skin wounds with bleeding risk.

6. Formation of a vascular tumor that is excessively large or abnormally enlarged.

7. Inability to feel pulsation or hear sounds in the dialysis catheter, which should raise suspicion of catheter obstruction.

8. Abnormal sounds from the dialysis catheter should raise suspicion of an impending obstruction.
