## Importance of Lower Limb Exercise Training

1. Chronic respiratory inflammation leading to airway obstruction may cause dynamic overinflation of the lungs, limiting patients' physical activity capacity.

2. Exercise training can reduce shortness of breath during physical activity and improve daily functioning and quality of life.

3. Lower limb exercise training includes endurance and resistance training; combining both types of training can enhance physical capacity and muscle strength.

4. Cycling should be performed with appropriate footwear. If a stationary bike is available, the speed and resistance can be adjusted accordingly.

5. Crab walking training is suitable for individuals with good balance and independent walking ability. It helps strengthen leg and hip muscles, reducing fall risk and improving daily living functions.

Perform moderate warm-up exercises.

If a stationary bicycle is available at home, it can be used to adjust speed and resistance.

Recommended amount: at least 3 times per week  
Each session: 15–20 minutes  
If discomfort occurs during exercise, pause and rest.  
The frequency and number of training sessions can be adjusted according to individual conditions.

Crab walking exercise is suitable for individuals with good balance and who can walk independently.  
For individuals with insufficient balance but who can still walk independently, it is recommended to use a wall for support during training.

There are many types and levels of commercially available resistance bands or elastic bands. Choose one that suits your needs.

Resistance bands of different strengths
