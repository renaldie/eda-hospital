## One. What is Emphysema

Emphysema (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the respiratory tract, characterized by irreversible obstructive lung disease. The primary cause of chronic inflammation is long-term irritation of the respiratory tract (such as smoking, dust, chemical substances, etc.). This inflammatory response leads to increased mucus secretion in the airways, resulting in bronchial obstruction and impaired gas exchange, causing breathing difficulties and other respiratory problems.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_897_630_1682_1188.jpg" alt="Image" width="46%" /></div>## What is pulmonary obstruction

Pulmonary obstruction ranks as the 9th leading cause of death in Taiwan (2022), causing over 5,000 deaths annually, accounting for 6%–10% of total mortality among the population, with a first-hospitalization mortality rate of 22%.

Common symptoms include "coughing, producing phlegm, and persistent shortness of breath," which are often mistaken for common cold or asthma symptoms and thus overlooked. If you have chronic coughing, expectoration, breathing difficulties, or a history of exposure to hazardous factors, it is recommended to seek medical attention for further examination and diagnosis.

## Physician Evaluation

## Has the patient smoked? Long-term smoking?

Does the patient frequently cough? Does the patient often produce sputum?

Does the patient experience sudden shortness of breath that is getting worse over time?

Is the patient particularly short of breath during physical activity (e.g., exercise, climbing stairs, lifting heavy objects)?

Does the patient have persistent shortness of breath?

Has the patient been exposed to kitchen oil fumes for a long time?

Has the patient been exposed to occupational dust (e.g., asbestos, silica, coal dust, cotton, grains) or chemicals (sulfuric acid, nitric acid, ammonia)?

Does a family member or relative have a history of pulmonary obstruction?

## Pulmonary Function Test

An essential diagnostic examination in thoracic medicine

A method to assess lung function by measuring lung volumes

During the test, the patient takes a deep breath and then forcefully exhales

The degree of airflow obstruction is evaluated using Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1)

If FEV1/FVC < 70%, it indicates airflow obstruction

Diagnosis of pulmonary obstruction is confirmed by combining physician assessment with symptom severity, smoking history, exposure to risk factors, chest X-ray, etc.## II. Overview of Diagnosis and Treatment of Pulmonary Obstruction

## Symptoms

In patients with pulmonary obstruction, acute deterioration primarily manifests as a sudden worsening of respiratory symptoms, with the degree of change exceeding their usual baseline, thus requiring a change in medication.

## Smoking Cessation and Vaccination

## Smoking Cessation

Tobacco contains over 7,000 chemicals,  
of which hundreds are toxic, and at least 93 are known carcinogens.  

Smoking is the leading risk factor for lung obstruction, leading to deterioration of lung function, reduced quality of life, and is associated with many of the top ten causes of death (such as malaria, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, etc.).

## According to statistical data:

Smokers are 25 times more likely to develop lung cancer than non-smokers, and smokers with lung obstruction are 120 times more likely to develop it.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_0_714_830_1178.jpg" alt="Image" width="49%" /></div>

## Comprehensive Lung Recovery Program

Lung recovery is a comprehensive intervention strategy individually tailored based on detailed patient assessments, including exercise training, health education (such as disease education, medication education, etc.), and promotion of healthy behaviors. The aim is to improve the physiological and psychological conditions of patients with obstructive lung disease and to enhance their long-term adherence to beneficial health behaviors.

## Exercise Training

Improve muscle strength and cardio-pulmonary function, reduce breathlessness during physical activity, and improve daily activities and quality of life.

## Pursed-Lip Breathing & Diaphragmatic Breathing

Through breathing exercises, the exhalation time can be increased to reduce lung gas retention, helping to decrease dynamic overinflation caused by exercise and thereby improving the patient's breathlessness.

If mild muscle fatigue is felt after training, apply gentle heat to relieve discomfort.  
If discomfort occurs during exercise, pause and rest.  
The frequency and number of training sessions can be adjusted according to individual conditions.

## Grip Ball (or Hand Grip Exercise)

Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterized by a decline in muscle mass, strength, and function throughout the body. Studies have found that approximately 27% of COPD patients have sarcopenia.  
Hand grip strength not only reflects hand muscle strength but also serves as the best indicator of overall muscle strength.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1569_254_1682_366.jpg" alt="Image" width="6%" /></div>

COPD patients with low grip strength and reduced skeletal and respiratory muscle function are at increased risk of acute exacerbations and mortality, leading to deterioration of lung function and reduced quality of life.  
Studies show that for every 1 kg decrease in grip strength, the risk of COPD worsening increases by 5%.

## Energy-Saving Techniques (also known as Work Simplification Techniques)

By arranging sequential actions, conserve energy and maintain independence in daily activities.

Appropriate use of energy-saving techniques can help patients with breathing difficulties and dyspnea during physical activity to perform daily living activities more easily. Combined with breathing exercises, these techniques can reduce the energy expenditure required during activities, thereby minimizing discomfort caused by the disease.

Energy-Saving Techniques

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_94_415_875_1189.jpg" alt="Image" width="46%" /></div>

Taking a bath while sitting

## Nutritional Care

About 30–60% of patients with pulmonary embolism have malnutrition. Maintaining ideal body weight and fluid balance is important.

Additionally, about 27% have sarcopenia (a syndrome characterized by decreased muscle mass, strength, and function throughout the body).

Declining respiratory muscle function increases the risk of acute exacerbations and mortality, worsens lung function, and affects quality of life.

## High-quality nutrition can improve symptoms and enhance quality of life

High-quality protein

Beans, fish, eggs, meat

One palm-sized portion

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_263_530_415_702.jpg" alt="Image" width="9%" /></div>
