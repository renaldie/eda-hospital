## Importance of Lower Limb Exercise Training

1. Chronic respiratory inflammation leading to airway obstruction may cause dynamic overinflation of the lungs, limiting patients' physical activity capacity.

2. Exercise training can reduce shortness of breath during physical activity and improve daily functioning and quality of life.

3. Lower limb exercise training includes endurance and resistance training; combining both types of training can enhance physical capacity and muscle strength.

4. Walking and treadmill training are suitable for individuals with good balance and can be combined with diaphragmatic breathing and abdominal breathing during training.
