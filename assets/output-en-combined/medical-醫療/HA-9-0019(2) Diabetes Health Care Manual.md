Date of Birth: ___

Name: ___## Symptoms and Management of Hyperglycemia

Symptoms:
1. Increased appetite, increased thirst, increased urination, weight loss, slow wound healing.

2. Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain may occur during ketoacidosis.

3. Severe cases may lead to confusion or shock.

Management:
Seek medical attention at a outpatient clinic or emergency department.

## Symptoms and Management of Hypoglycemia

Symptoms:
1. Hunger, trembling, cold sweats, dizziness.

2. Weakness and fatigue.

3. Palpitations.

4. Loss of consciousness.

Management:
Consume 120–150 ml of a sugary drink (about half a standard paper cup), or eat 3–5 pieces of sugar cubes, or one tablespoon of honey. If symptoms do not improve after 15 minutes, repeat the dose once more. If symptoms still do not improve, seek medical help immediately.

## Foot Care

1. Wash feet daily with warm water and soap.

2. Dry both feet and between the toes thoroughly.

3. Trim toenails evenly, not too short; file the edges smoothly.

4. Check for blisters, redness, or wounds.

5. Wear flat, comfortable shoes.

6. Avoid walking barefoot to prevent injury.

7. Wear clean, soft white socks that are not too tight or too loose.

8. Use lotion to keep skin moisturized.

9. Avoid using hot water bottles, heaters, or other heating devices on feet.

10. Avoid walking barefoot on health walking paths in parks.

## Dietary Principles

1. Avoid obesity and maintain a healthy body weight.

2. Eat meals at regular times and in fixed portions.

3. Limit intake of fried, pan-fried, or deep-fried foods, as well as skin from pork, chicken, duck, and fish, which are high in fat. Nuts such as peanuts, sesame seeds, walnuts, almonds, and cashews should be consumed in moderation due to their high fat and calorie content.4. Cooking should use plant-based oils and avoid animal fats; preferred cooking methods include steaming, boiling, cold-dressing, grilling, stewing, and pickling.

5. The diet of middle-aged and elderly individuals should not be overly salty, and they should limit intake of high-cholesterol foods such as internal organs, crab roe, shrimp roe, and fish roe. For patients with high cholesterol, egg yolks should not exceed 2–3 per week.

6. Choose high-fiber foods to slow down the rise of blood glucose.

7. Starchy foods such as sweet potatoes, potatoes, taro, corn, lotus seeds, chestnuts, red beans, green beans, fava beans, pumpkins, sweet paste, sushi, radish cake, curry dumplings should be consumed in moderation and not eaten arbitrarily.

8. Sugary snacks, condensed milk, honey, carbonated beverages, packaged or boxed fruit juices, preserved fruits, egg rolls, tapioca, wheat flour, noodles, bean threads, and rice vermicelli should be avoided as much as possible.

9. Avoid alcohol consumption.

10. Rice porridge and instant noodles should be consumed in minimal amounts.

11. Avoid foods with added sugar; individuals who enjoy sweet foods can use sugar substitutes (non-nutritive sweeteners) for flavoring.

12. Try to minimize attending banquets; if necessary, carefully select alternative food types and portion sizes.

## Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring

Due to fluctuations in blood glucose levels among diabetic patients caused by their physical condition, food intake, and medication absorption, relying solely on clinic glucose testing is insufficient. Patients must also use a glucometer to perform self-monitoring and record their glucose levels at home to help manage blood glucose and prevent hypoglycemia.

Although glucometers can provide timely glucose readings, they may be affected by factors such as test strip storage and operational technique. Therefore, regular calibration and verification of the glucometer are necessary.

## Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1C)

Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) is formed when glucose binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells. Red blood cells typically circulate in the body for about 120 days, so HbA1C can reflect average blood glucose levels over the three months prior to blood sampling. Higher levels indicate poor glucose control and serve as a key indicator of the effectiveness of diabetes management.
