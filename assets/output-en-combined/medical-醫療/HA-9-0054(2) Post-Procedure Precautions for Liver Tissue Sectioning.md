# Post-procedure Care for Liver Biopsy

## 1. Definitions

Liver biopsy is an invasive examination. Under ultrasound guidance, a physician uses a needle to obtain small pieces of liver tissue for pathological diagnosis, thereby determining the treatment plan or assessing the progression of liver disease.

## 2. Applicable Population

Patients who have undergone liver biopsy.

## 3. Care and Precautions

### 1. When can you start eating?

One hour after the procedure, if vital signs are stable and there is no discomfort, you may begin with a small amount of water. If there is no discomfort, gradually resume eating.

### 2. Sandbag application and bed rest time

After the procedure, you must remain absolutely bedridden for four hours and apply a sandbag to the puncture site to prevent bleeding. During this period, nursing staff will monitor your blood pressure and heart rate according to medical instructions and assess your condition.

### 3. Management of wound pain

Mild abdominal pain can be managed with pain medication. If you experience severe abdominal pain, difficulty breathing, cold sweats, an accelerated heartbeat, or confusion, you must immediately notify medical staff.

On the day of the procedure, avoid exposing the wound to water. The next day, keep the wound dry and clean it normally.## Post-operative Care for Liver Biopsy
