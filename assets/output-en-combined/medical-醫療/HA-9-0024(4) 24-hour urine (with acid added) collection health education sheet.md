Items used during urine collection

□ Round-bottom urine collection tube ___ pieces □ 6N hydrochloric acid ___ pieces □ 24-hour urine collection container 1 set □ Pipette 1 piece

## II. Pre-collection Instructions:

1. The glass tube containing 6N hydrochloric acid is a corrosive chemical. Please handle with care, store it out of reach of children. If accidental skin or eye contact occurs, rinse thoroughly with large amounts of water for 20–30 minutes and seek medical attention immediately. In case of accidental ingestion, do not induce vomiting. If conscious, rinse the mouth thoroughly with water, drink a large amount of water or milk (at least 250 cc), and seek medical help. If unconscious, do not give any food or drink and go to the hospital immediately.

2. Women should not undergo testing during menstruation.

3. For 3 days prior to collection, avoid consuming chocolate, coffee, bananas, citrus fruits, aspirin, and antihypertensive medications to prevent false elevations (patients under treatment for hypertension should still take their medications as prescribed by their physician).

4. All urine voids during the 24-hour period must be collected. During collection, keep the urine cold (store in the refrigerator, but avoid freezing).

## III. Collection Procedure:

1. It is recommended to collect a 24-hour urine sample from a specific time point—for example, from 8 a.m. (or any specific time) to the same time the next day (e.g., 8 a.m. the following day), totaling 24 hours.

2. At 8 a.m. (or any specific time on the first day), regardless of whether you feel the urge to urinate, you must void your first urine. This urine belongs to the period before 8 a.m. and should not be collected.

3. The second urine void begins collection. After collecting into the urine container, immediately add one tube of 6N hydrochloric acid and mix thoroughly (please first add urine before adding the 6N hydrochloric acid to avoid splashing). After starting collection, keep the urine container refrigerated at all times. When you need to collect urine, simply remove the container from the refrigerator. Continue collecting urine until the final void at the same time the next day is collected, completing the 24-hour urine collection.

4. Record the total 24-hour urine volume on the first round-bottom urine collection tube. Mix the urine container thoroughly and withdraw 10 cc into the first round-bottom urine collection tube.

5. If the 24-hour period has not yet ended and the urine container is full, first record the total volume of the first urine container, withdraw 10 cc of urine into the first round-bottom urine collection tube. Empty the urine container and continue collecting urine, adding the second tube of 6N hydrochloric acid. Continue collecting until the 24-hour period ends. Record the total volume of the second urine container, and add this to the volume of the first container to obtain the total 24-hour urine volume. Record the total volume on the second round-bottom urine collection tube. Mix the urine from the second container thoroughly and withdraw 10 cc into the second round-bottom urine collection tube. Submit both the first and second round-bottom urine collection tubes.

## Total final urine volume equals the volume voided plus the volume in the collection container.

## IV. Post-collection Instructions:

1. During transportation, place ice packs or ice blocks outside the specimen bag to maintain a cold environment. Deliver the specimen to the laboratory/department receiving window and confirm the total 24-hour urine volume with the receiving staff.

2. Specimen receiving hours:
