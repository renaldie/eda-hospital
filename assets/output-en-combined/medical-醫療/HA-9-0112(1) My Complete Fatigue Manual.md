Cancer has held the top spot among Taiwan's top ten causes of death for over a year. This disease and its treatments often bring physical discomfort, psychological stress, and even disrupt family life. Among these, "cancer-related fatigue" is particularly troubling to patients. Therefore, the team has specially prepared this handbook to assist patients in monitoring their fatigue levels at home and learning methods to alleviate fatigue, thereby improving their quality of life.

## How Fatigued Are You?

## What Is Cancer-Related Fatigue?

It is a significant feeling of fatigue caused by cancer or cancer treatment, which reduces activity levels and interest in daily activities, increases psychological stress, and causes sleep disturbances, ultimately affecting quality of life. 

Cancer-related fatigue can occur with any treatment method, medication, or stage of cancer.
