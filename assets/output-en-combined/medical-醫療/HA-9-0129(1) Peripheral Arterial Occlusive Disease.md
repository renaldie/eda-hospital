## Five. Surgical Treatment for Peripheral Arterial Occlusion

When medication cannot control the condition, doctors may recommend surgery to restore blood flow. Surgery can be divided into two types:

1. Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (commonly known as balloon angioplasty): In this procedure, the doctor makes a small incision through the skin of the ankle or hand, inserts a catheter into the blood vessel, passes it through the narrowed section, inflates a balloon to widen the vessel, and improves blood flow. Depending on the patient's vascular condition, the doctor may decide to place a stent to support the vessel. This surgery is performed under local anesthesia and has a quick recovery time.

2. Bypass Surgery: When the blockage is severe, the blocked vessel must be replaced with either the patient's own blood vessel or an artificial one. This procedure is used in such cases.

## Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1156_257_1645_829.jpg" alt="Image" width="29%" /></div>One. What is peripheral arterial occlusive disease?

Your blood vessels develop atherosclerosis, causing the vessels to narrow, become blocked, and result in poor blood flow.

## Two. What are the symptoms of peripheral arterial occlusive disease?

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_581_91_1053_530.jpg" alt="Image" width="28%" /></div>

Pain in the buttocks, thighs, or calves during physical activity or when climbing stairs, which gradually worsens with disease progression. Symptoms range from cold feet and numbness to intermittent claudication, and eventually lead to chronic non-healing wounds and tissue necrosis.

## Three. What tests are needed to determine if one has peripheral arterial occlusive disease?

1. Doppler blood flow test: Used to assess the degree of blood flow in the feet' arteries, allowing for an initial evaluation of arterial narrowing or blockage.

2. Peripheral vascular ultrasound: An advanced color Doppler vascular ultrasound examination used to thoroughly understand the condition of peripheral blood vessels and serve as a basis for treatment.

3. CT angiography: A diagnostic tool combining X-ray and computer imaging. The procedure takes about 15–20 minutes and enables precise visualization of specific blood vessels.

4. Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA): A relatively new and highly accurate examination method that can clearly show the exact location of vascular blockages.

## Four. Precautions

1. Quit smoking (including secondhand smoke): Smoking is the biggest risk factor, as nicotine causes atherosclerosis, accelerates vascular constriction, and inhibits the formation of collateral circulation. Therefore, smoking must be absolutely avoided.

2. Treat diabetes and keep blood glucose levels within an ideal range.

3. Improve high lipid levels.

4. Control blood pressure.

5. Manage other systemic diseases, such as coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease.

6. If BMI (body weight ÷ height in meters squared) exceeds 25, lose weight.

7. Improve anemia and blood viscosity.

8. Pay attention to foot care, especially for diabetic patients, who should wear properly fitted shoes to avoid injury or infection.

9. Engage in moderate physical activity to enhance collateral circulation.
