## Understanding Active Breathing Control

Objective:

During breathing, organs in the chest and abdomen move within the body as they expand and contract. By inhaling fully and then holding the breath, the following can be achieved: (1) reduce errors in the treatment area caused by breathing, thereby improving treatment accuracy; (2) when fully inhaling, the lung volume increases, which reduces the irradiated area of the lungs and moves the chest wall away from the heart, thus decreasing the radiation dose received by the lungs and heart, and reducing side effects to the lungs and heart.

Hold the breathing tube at the front end with your mouth, perform lung breathing, and do not use abdominal breathing. Use a nose clip to restrict nasal breathing. Wear a reflective eyeglass and adjust the viewing angle so that you can see the time and breathing waveform displayed on the computer screen (as shown in the figure below).

The radiographer will give you a button controller. Please hold it and continuously press the sensor button. When you press the button, the line on the screen will turn blue.

Then follow the voice instructions from the radiographer. When we say, "It's time to begin—please start deep breathing. As you inhale, the blue line on the screen will rise until it reaches the preset value (green zone). At that point, the machine will automatically block the breathing tube to help you hold your breath, and a number in the lower right corner will begin counting down. Once the number reaches zero, you may breathe normally.

If you experience any discomfort during the breath-holding process, simply release the button on the controller or exhale to resume normal breathing. Additionally, during the first time you are in the CT localization room to create a mold, if you experience any discomfort or find it difficult to synchronize with the breath-holding time using the respiratory control system, please immediately inform the radiographer so they can assist you in adjusting the settings.
