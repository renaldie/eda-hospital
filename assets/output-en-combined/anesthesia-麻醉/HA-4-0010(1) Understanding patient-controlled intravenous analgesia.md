## What is Intravenous Patient Controlled Analgesia?

The medication is stored in an infusion pump, and the dosage is set according to the patient's pain level. When you feel pain, you can press the control button yourself to receive pain medication through the vein, achieving pain relief.

This is an advanced drug delivery device. When you feel pain, you can press the medication button, and the machine will inject the analgesic, providing pain relief within about 5 minutes.

## Indications for Patient-Controlled Analgesia

Post-surgical wound pain, fractures and trauma, cancer-related pain, etc.

## Common Side Effects

Since the medication used is an opioid analgesic, possible discomforts may include nausea, vomiting, bloating, dizziness, skin itching, difficulty urinating, drowsiness, and excessive sleepiness. If you experience any of these symptoms, please inform the ward nurse and contact the pain nurse for treatment.

## How to Use Patient-Controlled Analgesia

Currently, the National Health Insurance does not cover patient-controlled analgesia, and it must be paid for out-of-pocket. Refunds are not available, and the service cannot be shared with others. If you need it, please inform the pre-anesthesia evaluation outpatient clinic or the ward nurse of your intention to use it.
