# Postoperative Instructions for General Anesthesia

## Introduction

General anesthesia is a method that uses drugs to induce a state similar to sleep or unconsciousness during surgery or examination, so the patient will have no memory of the procedure.

## Procedure Description

A type of anesthesia that ensures the patient feels no pain or sensation during surgery or examination. After the procedure, the patient will be transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit for observation until stable before being allowed to return home.

## Home Return Precautions

☐ Activity: For 24 hours after anesthesia and sedation, do not drive, ride a bicycle, or take a ride on a motorbike. Avoid making important decisions or engaging in hazardous work. Rest at home as much as possible. If you must go out, do so with a healthy adult accompanying you.

☐ Diet: After returning home, if there is no nausea or vomiting, start with water or liquid food. Once nausea and vomiting have ceased, return to normal eating.

□ Pain: Mild pain at the surgical site is normal. Take pain medication prescribed by your doctor.

☐ Nausea and Vomiting: It is common to experience mild nausea and vomiting after surgery or examination.

## Seek Medical Attention Immediately If Any of the Following Symptoms Occur:

(1) Significant bleeding at the surgical site.  
(2) Feeling cold or fever (body temperature exceeding $ 38^{\circ}C $).  
(3) Chest pain: sharp, stabbing pain or difficulty breathing.  
(4) Persistent nausea and vomiting.  
(5) Pain that does not subside.

※ Special Notes for Gynecological Patients: ☐ Removal of gauze block on month/day/hour.

If no special symptoms are present, please visit the clinic as scheduled.
