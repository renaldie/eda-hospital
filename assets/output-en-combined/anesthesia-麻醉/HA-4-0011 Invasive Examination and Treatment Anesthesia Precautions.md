## Preoperative Education and Anesthesia Consent Form

For invasive examinations and treatments requiring anesthesia, the following procedures must be followed:

1. Patients who have completed the anesthesia assessment should arrive 30 minutes early on the day of the examination to receive pre-examination preparation. Patients who have not completed the anesthesia assessment should arrive one hour early and proceed to the Anesthesia Assessment Outpatient Clinic on the third floor to complete the evaluation.

2. On the day of the examination, fast for at least 8 hours from your last regular meal or fatty foods; simple meals or dairy products should be avoided for at least 6 hours; breastfeeding mothers should avoid feeding for at least 4 hours. Clear fluids such as plain water or clear tea can be consumed in quantities greater than 2 hours. Patients taking anti-hypoglycemic medications should refrain from taking them on the day of the examination. For patients with hypertension, if the examination is scheduled in the morning, the medication should be taken before 6:00 a.m. on the day of the examination; if the examination is scheduled in the afternoon, the medication should be taken before 9:00 a.m. on the day of the examination.

3. Remove any removable dental prostheses, nail polish, or contact lenses prior to the examination.

4. A family member must accompany the patient on the day of the examination. The patient must not drive themselves home to ensure safety.
