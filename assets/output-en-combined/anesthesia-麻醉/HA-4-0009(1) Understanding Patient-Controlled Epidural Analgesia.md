## What is Epidural Patient Controlled Analgesia?

The anesthesiologist will temporarily place a catheter into the epidural space of your back. The machine will then be connected to the catheter, continuously delivering analgesic medication. The medication is delivered through the catheter into the epidural space, locally blocking the nerve pathways that transmit pain signals, thereby achieving pain relief. When you feel pain, you can press the control button yourself to receive additional medication.

This is an advanced drug delivery machine. When you feel pain, you can press the medication button, and the machine will inject analgesic medication. Pain relief typically begins within 10–15 minutes.

## Indications for Epidural Patient Controlled Analgesia

Severe postoperative wound pain after thoracic or abdominal surgery, pain relief during childbirth, and cancer-related pain.

## Common Side Effects

Possible side effects include nausea, vomiting, bloating, dizziness, skin itching, difficulty urinating, drowsiness, and excessive sleepiness. Due to the presence of local anesthetics, some patients may experience numbness or weakness in their limbs. These symptoms are usually temporary and will resolve as the medication is metabolized.

If you experience any of the above symptoms, please inform the ward nurse and contact the pain nurse for assistance.

## How to Use Patient-Controlled Analgesia

Currently, the National Health Insurance does not cover patient-controlled analgesia, and it must be paid for out-of-pocket. Refunds are not available. If you have a need, please inform the pre-anesthesia evaluation outpatient clinic or ward nurse of your intention to use it.
