## Children's abdominal pain precautions

1. Seek medical attention immediately if the child experiences sudden severe abdominal pain, worsened crying when the abdomen is pressed, swelling on the side of the genital area, persistent abdominal pain with increased pain in the lower right abdomen upon pressure, persistent nausea and vomiting with abdominal muscle rigidity, even resembling a hard board, or nausea, vomiting, and bloody stools.

2. Take medication as prescribed by the doctor and eat small, frequent meals with gentle, non-irritating, non-fried foods.

3. If vomiting or severe abdominal pain occurs, temporarily avoid eating or drinking until symptoms improve and the doctor gives permission to resume a light diet.
