## Chest Pain Awareness

1. Chest pain is one of the symptoms of many cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases as well as thoracic wall skeletal and nervous muscle disorders, and may indicate serious underlying conditions—do not take it lightly.

2. If the chest pain is severe, persistent, or does not relieve, or if chest pain is accompanied by shortness of breath, cold sweats, dizziness, or other physical discomforts, seek medical attention immediately.

3. Chronic disease patients should take their medications as prescribed and should not stop taking them without reason, especially patients with heart disease.

4. In case of severe chest pain, patients can seek help at the emergency room.

5. After discharge from the emergency room, chest pain patients should still follow their doctor's instructions and visit the relevant outpatient department within a short period to identify potential underlying diseases.
