## Precautions for Acute Pyelonephritis

1. If no contraindications, consume at least 2000–3000 ml of fluids daily.

2. Maintain good hygiene in the perineal area, urinate every 1–2 hours, and avoid holding urine.

3. Follow medication instructions strictly; during the acute phase, rest in bed and avoid eating spicy foods or alcohol and tobacco.

4. Even after the acute phase, continue outpatient follow-up examinations and do not discontinue medication on your own to prevent recurrence.

5. If high fever, chills, or severe flank pain occur, seek medical attention promptly.
