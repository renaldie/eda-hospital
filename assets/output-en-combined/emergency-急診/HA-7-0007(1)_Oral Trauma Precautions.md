## ☐ Oral Trauma Precautions

1. After each meal, rinse your mouth with warm salt water or mouthwash to keep the oral cavity clean.

2. For sutured wounds in the oral cavity, sutures are generally not removed. However, if the suture ends are still visible or if you feel foreign body sensation after 10 days, please visit the oral surgery outpatient clinic for treatment.

3. Depending on individual conditions, consume soft or liquid foods (such as fruit juice, milk, or porridge), and avoid rough, irritating, or hot foods.

4. If signs of infection appear in the wound, such as redness, swelling, pain, purulent discharge, or fever, or if you experience unusual pain or high fever with chills, please visit the clinic promptly.

5. Please return to the outpatient clinic as scheduled for follow-up.
