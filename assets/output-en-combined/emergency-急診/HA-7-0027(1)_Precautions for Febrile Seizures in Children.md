## Precautions for Childhood Febrile Seizures

### 1. Causes of febrile seizures:

When a child has a fever, the entire body or a specific limb experiences convulsions, often accompanied by temporary loss of consciousness—this is known as a febrile seizure. These typically occur within the first 24 hours of fever onset, usually happen only once, last for a few minutes, stop quickly, and the child regains consciousness shortly afterward without any paralysis or confusion. Fortunately, febrile seizures become rare after the age of five.

### 2. How to handle febrile seizures:

Since simple, sudden febrile seizures are rarely immediately life-threatening and do not result in neurological complications, it is important to remain calm. Lay the child flat on a safe, non-slip surface such as a bed or floor. Take the child's temperature and administer an enema to reduce fever. If vomiting occurs, turn the child's head to one side to prevent aspiration and clear the vomit. Ensure the airway remains open. If there is no obvious tongue biting, do not insert any object into the mouth to prevent tongue injury, as such objects may cause suffocation or induce vomiting. Monitor the child's breathing and heartbeat. If the seizure continues beyond several minutes, seek emergency medical care immediately. After the child has regained consciousness, closely observe for any signs of altered mental status, persistent vomiting, severe headache, neck stiffness or pain, unrelenting high fever, or any signs of limb paralysis.
