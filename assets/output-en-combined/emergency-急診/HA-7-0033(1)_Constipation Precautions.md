## Constipation Precautions

1. Maintain a balanced diet, consume more vegetables and fruits, avoid spicy foods, alcohol, and coffee; if possible, drink at least eight cups of water daily.

2. Increase daily physical activity and exercise.

3. Establish a regular bowel routine; the best time to go to the toilet is 15–20 minutes after breakfast. When you feel the urge to defecate, do not hold it in. Allow sufficient time to use the toilet and avoid excessive straining.

4. Do not self-medicate with laxatives or enemas without a doctor's instruction. Please return for follow-up at the clinic.

5. Abdominal massage (in a clockwise direction) can promote intestinal peristalsis.
