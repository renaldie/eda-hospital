## Asthma Precautions

1. To prevent attacks, carry medication at all times as needed, and follow your doctor's medication instructions.

2. Avoid exposure to allergens such as: tobacco smoke, smoke, pollen, cold air, dust, dust mites, or pets.

3. Wear a mask and scarf when there is a large temperature difference; avoid public places during flu season; engage in appropriate physical activity and maintain a balanced, moderate diet.

4. In case of acute asthma attack, administer oxygen or bronchodilators as instructed by your doctor. When symptoms improve, have the patient sit up, refrain from eating, and avoid getting up or moving around randomly.

5. Seek immediate medical follow-up if acute wheezing, rapid breathing, cyanosis, or ineffective symptom relief after using inhalers occur, or if there is a high fever, chills, coughing with abundant yellow sputum.
