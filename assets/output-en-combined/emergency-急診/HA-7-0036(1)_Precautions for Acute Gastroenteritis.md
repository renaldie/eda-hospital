## Precautions for Acute Gastroenteritis

1. During the acute phase, reduce or temporarily stop eating; during fasting, you can moisten your lips with water or chew on ice cubes if thirsty.

2. If using anti-diarrheal medication, discontinue it when diarrhea has ceased.

3. Prevent dehydration and pay attention to water and electrolyte replenishment; you may drink a diluted sports drink (half water, half original).

4. Avoid drinking milk and dairy products, oily foods, and spicy foods.

5. After symptoms improve, try giving plain water first; if no discomfort occurs, gradually introduce small amounts of light foods (such as porridge, rice soup, white toast, fruit juice).

6. If vomiting occurs again, rest for several hours before eating.

7. Prevention methods: wash hands frequently, pay attention to cooking environment, and emphasize food hygiene.

8. Mild diarrhea can be managed at home; however, if vomiting persists, diarrhea continues, dehydration or shock occurs, pain shifts to the lower right abdomen, or fever is high, seek medical attention promptly.
