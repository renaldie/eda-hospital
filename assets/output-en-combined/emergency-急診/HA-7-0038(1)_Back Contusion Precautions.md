(2) Invert the cold pack to check for leaks; wrap it in a dry towel and apply it to the injured area  
(3) Apply ice four times daily, each session for 15–20 minutes, with a rest period in between

5. Take medications as prescribed and attend regular outpatient follow-up visits.

6. If you experience hematuria, back pain accompanied by cold sweats, please go to the emergency department immediately.
