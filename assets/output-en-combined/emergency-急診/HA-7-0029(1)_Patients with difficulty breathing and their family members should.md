## Things to Pay Attention to for Patients with Dyspnea and Their Family Members

1. Dyspnea is one of the symptoms of many cardiovascular, pulmonary, and respiratory diseases. If a patient experiences dyspnea, both the patient and their family should pay close attention and closely monitor any changes. Even if there is no prior history of cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, one should not be careless.

2. Chronic disease patients should take their medications as prescribed by their doctor. If there are any changes in their condition, they should visit the relevant department for follow-up examination within a short period of time, or seek medical attention immediately.

3. In cases of dyspnea, shortness of breath, or cyanosis, first place the patient in a sitting position, refrain from feeding them, and avoid allowing them to get up and move around arbitrarily. Administer oxygen or emergency medications as instructed by the doctor to relieve symptoms, and seek medical help immediately.

4. After discharge from our hospital's outpatient clinic, if a patient develops persistent high fever, chest pain, cold sweats, cyanosis, inability to lie flat to sleep, or swelling in the lower limbs, they should go directly to the emergency department for assistance.
