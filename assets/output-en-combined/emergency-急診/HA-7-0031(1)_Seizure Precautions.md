## Precautions for Seizures

1. When a seizure occurs, place the patient flat with their head tilted to one side to prevent vomit from blocking the airway. If the jaw is clenched and the tongue is biting into the mouth, do not forcibly open the teeth.

2. Do not forcefully restrain the patient's limbs or attempt to stop the convulsions. Guide the patient to sit or lie down to prevent head injuries, and keep them away from hazards to avoid fractures or other injuries.

3. Observe and record the duration of the seizure, symptoms, what the patient was doing during the episode, and the total duration of the seizure. This information will help doctors make a diagnosis and provide treatment. Seek immediate medical attention.

4. Patients with a history of seizures should take medication as prescribed by their doctor, avoid infections and fever, intense sound or light stimuli, refrain from drinking alcohol, maintain a balanced diet and sufficient sleep, and undergo regular outpatient follow-ups for control.
