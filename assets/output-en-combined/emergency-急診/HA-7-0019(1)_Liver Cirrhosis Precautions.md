## Liver Cirrhosis Precautions

1. Follow instructions to consume a high-carbohydrate diet and a high-protein diet (e.g., fish, meat, eggs, dairy); however, if hepatic encephalopathy occurs, protein intake should be restricted.

2. For patients with esophageal varices, avoid rough, hard, or excessively hot foods; chew food thoroughly and slowly.

3. Patients with ascites or edema should follow a low-sodium diet and limit fluid intake.

4. Eat small, frequent meals, maintain a regular lifestyle, ensure adequate rest, avoid intense physical activity, and quit smoking and drinking.

5. Prevent infections, monitor for signs of bleeding (such as skin bruising, gingival bleeding, or black tarry stools), and attend regular outpatient follow-ups.

6. Avoid straining during bowel movements; eat more vegetables and fruits to prevent constipation.

7. In cases of massive hematemesis, bloody stools, severe jaundice, coma, abdominal pain with fever, seek medical attention immediately.
