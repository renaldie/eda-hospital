## Children's fever precautions

1. Get plenty of rest, and replenish fluids such as water, juice, glucose water, or glucose electrolyte solution.

2. Do not dress the child in too many clothes or cover them with too thick a blanket. If clothes become wet, change them immediately.

3. Maintain a normal indoor temperature and take medication regularly as instructed by the doctor.

4. Take the child's temperature every 4 hours; if the ear temperature exceeds 39°C and there is no chills, use an ice pack or take a lukewarm bath (water temperature between 30–34°C) to reduce body temperature. If there is no chills, use an ice pack. If the ear temperature exceeds 38°C, administer oral fever-reducing medication as advised by the doctor. If the ear temperature exceeds 38.5°C, administer a rectal suppository as instructed by the doctor. The suppository should be used every 4–6 hours (the suppository should be stored in the refrigerator to prevent melting).

5. Stay calm when the child has a fever. Observe the child's mental alertness and activity level. If necessary, call the doctor to determine whether an urgent visit or follow-up at the outpatient clinic is needed.

6. If the child has persistent high fever, headache, neck stiffness, difficulty breathing, excessive yellow sputum, loss of appetite, drowsiness, poor activity, or is almost unable to eat, seek medical attention promptly.
