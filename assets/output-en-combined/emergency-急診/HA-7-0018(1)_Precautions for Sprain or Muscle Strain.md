## Precautions for Sprains or Muscle Strains

1. Rest adequately, avoid further activity, and reduce the risk of re-injury.

2. Pain is usually most severe within 2–3 days after injury. During this period, apply ice to the injured area, continuing this step for 24–48 hours.

(1) Place ice cubes into an ice pack and add water to one-third of the container  
(2) Invert the ice pack to check for leaks; wrap the ice pack in a dry towel and apply it to the affected area.  
(3) Apply ice four times daily, each session for 15–20 minutes, with a rest period in between.

3. Elevate the injured limb as much as possible, wear properly sized shoes (avoid high heels), and refrain from massage.

4. If pain is unbearable or if swelling and bruising continue to worsen after treatment, seek follow-up medical care.
