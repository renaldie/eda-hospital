## Urinary Tract Stones

1. Sudden, severe, sharp pain originating in the back and radiating to the sides; in males, it extends down to the testicles; in females, it reaches the bladder.

2. When pain is severe, nausea, vomiting, pallor, and cold sweats may occur. Frequent urination or difficulty in urination may also appear.

3. Drink at least 3,000–4,000 mL of fluids daily (approximately 8 large cups) as instructed. This increases urine volume, reduces the concentration of solutes in urine, and prevents urine stasis.

4. Urinate every 2 hours; do not hold urine, as this can prevent urine stasis.

5. Regular outpatient follow-up is required to determine whether the stones have been expelled.
