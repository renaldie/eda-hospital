## Tips for Managing Nosebleeds

1. Avoid prolonged exposure to air-conditioned rooms or picking the nose, as this can dry out and damage the nasal mucosa, leading to nosebleeds or infections.

2. When experiencing a nosebleed, prioritize stopping the bleeding. Have the patient sit upright; if necessary, insert a tissue strip into the nostrils. If bleeding continues, apply pressure to the bridge of the nose or use cold compresses (note: for trauma patients, do not blindly block the nostrils to prevent aspiration of blood into the airway and potential suffocation).

3. For patients with hypertension, if blood pressure readings are higher than usual, take emergency antihypertensive medication as prescribed by a doctor, rest, avoid excessive physical exertion or movement, and maintain a semi-reclining position while managing the bleeding.

4. Follow the medication recommendations and usage instructions provided by the emergency physician. Do not remove the nasal packing (gauze or cotton swab) inserted into the nasal cavity without medical instruction. Return to the hospital as advised by the doctor for follow-up examination.

5. Individuals who regularly take anticoagulant medications (such as those who have undergone heart surgery or suffered ischemic stroke), aspirin, or have coagulation disorders (e.g., hemophilia, liver cirrhosis or liver cancer, hematological dysfunction), or those with head and neck cancers (such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma), should seek immediate medical attention if bleeding cannot be controlled.
