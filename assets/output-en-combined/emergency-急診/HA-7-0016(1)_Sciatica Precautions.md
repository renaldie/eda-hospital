## Caution for Sciatica

1. Try to avoid lifting heavy objects, intense back movements, and bending over.

2. Maintain proper sitting and standing postures, and avoid wearing high-heeled shoes.

3. When experiencing pain, try to rest in bed as much as possible.

4. Avoid sleeping on spring mattresses or foam mattresses; instead, sleep on a hard mattress.

5. Eat more fruits and vegetables to prevent constipation.

6. Wear waist supports or back braces daily to protect the lower back.

7. Visit the orthopedic or neurosurgical outpatient clinic.

8. If you experience progressive paralysis, incontinence, inability to urinate, or severe abdominal pain, seek emergency medical care immediately.
