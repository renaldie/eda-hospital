## Care Instructions for a Cast

1. Purpose of the cast: To immobilize the bone, maintain the normal anatomical position of the fractured bone, and allow the bone to heal naturally.

2. Post-cast care for the affected limb:

(1) Keep the fingers and toes of the casted limb clean, and apply lotion gently to prevent dryness and cracking.

(2) Do not insert sharp objects into the cast to avoid skin injury. Educate children not to put toys, food, toothbrushes, buttons, or other items inside the cast.

(3) Avoid impact with hard objects, as this may cause deformation or cracking of the cast.

(4) Keep the cast clean and dry.

(5) Elevate the casted limb slightly above heart level to promote venous return and reduce swelling and pain.

(6) Perform muscle contraction exercises for 15–20 minutes each time, three times daily. Example: clenched fist.

(7) Practice lifting and lowering movements of the casted limb daily while lying on the bed or sitting on a chair.

3. When should follow-up at the outpatient clinic be scheduled after casting?

4. If there is pain, pallor, cyanosis, coldness, or numbness in the distal tips (fingers or toes) of the casted limb.

5. If the cast breaks or shatters.

6. If the cast feels too loose or too tight.

7. If there is a specific sensation of sharp pain or discomfort on the skin inside the cast.

8. Avoid eating spicy foods and overeating.
