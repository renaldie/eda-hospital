## Chest injury precautions

1. Even after excluding pneumothorax or rib fractures, there may still be potential pulmonary contusion; therefore, the patient's respiratory condition should be closely monitored.

2. If there are obvious bruising on the neck, difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, cold sweat, pale complexion, cyanosis, severe chest pain, or back discomfort, inform the medical staff immediately.

3. After returning home, take medications as instructed by the doctor, rest adequately, avoid strenuous work, and attend follow-up appointments as scheduled.

4. If severe symptoms such as coughing up blood, difficulty breathing, or rapid breathing occur at home, assume a seated position, refrain from eating or drinking, and avoid getting up. Contact the clinic by phone or visit the clinic for medical care (emergency hotline: 615-0995).
