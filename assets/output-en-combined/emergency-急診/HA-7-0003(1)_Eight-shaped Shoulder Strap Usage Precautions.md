## Eight-character shoulder sling usage precautions

1. Most clavicle fractures can be effectively treated with an eight-character shoulder sling; only a few cases require surgical intervention, which will be decided by an orthopedic doctor during an orthopedic outpatient visit.

2. The eight-character shoulder sling should be worn for 4–6 weeks, or even up to three months. During the first two weeks of use, it is recommended to combine it with an arm sling to stabilize the affected arm and reduce pain.

3. For the first 1–2 weeks, it is best to avoid bathing and instead use a damp cloth to clean the body. If bathing is unavoidable, please maintain proper posture and carefully remove the eight-character shoulder sling. After bathing, quickly put the sling back on (with hands inserted into the waist, chest raised, and family members helping from behind to adjust the sponge pads and evenly tighten both straps). If discomfort persists, please return to the clinic promptly.

4. Wear the eight-character shoulder sling over a thin cotton garment, not over thick clothing. When sleeping, lie flat and avoid lying on your side.

5. Pain usually lasts 1–2 weeks. Take pain medication prescribed by your doctor and attend regular orthopedic outpatient follow-ups.
