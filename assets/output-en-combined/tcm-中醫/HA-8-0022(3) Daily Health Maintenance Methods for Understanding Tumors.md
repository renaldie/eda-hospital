E-Da Healthcare Foundation  
E-DA HEALTHCARE GROUPCancer is not an incurable disease beyond treatment. In both Western and traditional Chinese medicine, alternative therapies often serve as supportive measures in disease recovery. The theory of medical and health preservation emphasizes maintaining the body's vital energy (zheng qi), involving dietary guidelines, daily routines, mental well-being, physical activity, medication, and qigong. The following recommendations are suggested:

## I. Daily Lifestyle Adjustment

Hippocrates, the father of Western medicine, once said: "Food is the best medicine." The American Cancer Society (ACS) points out that cancer patients undergoing treatment who eat well and maintain adequate nutrition enjoy six key benefits:

(1) A more cheerful mood.  
(2) Maintained physical strength and vitality.  
(3) Stable body weight, helping the body store energy.  
(4) Greater ability to tolerate the side effects of cancer treatments.  
(5) Reduced risk of infection.  
(6) Faster wound healing and improved recovery.

## II. Mental Well-being – Relaxation and Joy

Modern medicine has found that cancer patients who maintain a cheerful disposition can experience alleviation of their condition. Laughter has the following effects on the human body:

(1) Increases lung capacity and clears the respiratory tract.  
(2) Releases positive emotions and relieves nervous tension.  
(3) Promotes smooth circulation of qi and blood, enhancing immunity.  
(4) Relaxes muscles and nerves throughout the body.  
(5) Distributes excess energy.  
(6) Alleviates depression and reduces mental stress.  
(7) Encourages social interaction and strengthens friendships.

## III. Exercise and Energy

Physical exercise promotes the smooth flow of qi and blood, strengthens bones and muscles, and enhances the health of internal organs. One should exercise according to their own physical capacity and maintain regular, consistent activity. Not only does this benefit the body, but it also cultivates perseverance and sharpens mental resilience.

## IV. Dietary Regulation

(1) Adhere to three core principles: "balanced diet, increased caloric intake, and increased protein." During treatment, it is essential to supplement high-nutrient, high-vitamin foods that are easily absorbed, which can enhance bodily functions and immune capacity.

(2) Practice "small meals throughout the day": consume small, nutritious snacks between meals to boost energy levels.

(3) "Five servings of vegetables and fruits daily" for cancer prevention and overall health: research has shown that lycopene and anthocyanins are powerful antioxidants that help neutralize free radicals and strengthen the body's immune system.

(4) Avoid "smoked and grilled foods": smoked or nitrite-added meats such as sausages and cured meats contain carcinogenic substances.

(5) Limit intake of "high-fat and high-sugar foods": According to the World Health Organization (WHO), excessive consumption of sugar and fats increases cancer risk. Cancer cells prefer sugars; excessive glucose intake can accelerate cancer cell growth and lead to disease progression.

(6) Minimize consumption of "processed pickled foods."

(7) "Avoid raw foods": during treatment, immune function declines and resistance weakens, making raw food consumption more likely to cause infection.

## V. Acupressure

### (1) Neiguan Point:

Located 2 cun (three finger-widths) above the wrist transverse crease, midway between two muscles. Press with the pad of your finger for 3 minutes. This helps descend stomach qi, smooth the gastrointestinal tract, and relieve nausea.
