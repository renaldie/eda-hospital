## One: Understanding Cupping Therapy

Cupping is a traditional Chinese external treatment method that involves removing air from a cup to create negative pressure, which adheres to various meridians or acupoints. It helps relieve pain, promote blood circulation, dispel wind and cold, and regulate bodily functions.

## Two: Pre-treatment Guidelines

1. Keep the skin clean and remove any topical medications or foreign substances.

2. Wear loose clothing to easily expose the treatment area.

3. Avoid treatment on an empty or overly full stomach; maintain a relaxed emotional state.

4. It is recommended to have a family member accompany you, and maintain a stable supine position during the treatment.

5. If you have a history of skin diseases, bleeding tendencies, pregnancy, heart disease, or epilepsy, please inform your doctor so that the suitability of the treatment can be properly assessed.

## Three: During Treatment Guidelines

1. During cupping, sensations such as tightness, pulling, warmth, or mild itching are normal. If you experience dizziness, chest tightness, excessive sweating, difficulty breathing, or severe pain, please immediately inform the doctor or nurse.

2. Do not move your body or change your posture on your own.

3. The typical treatment duration is 5 to 10 minutes. Do not extend the time excessively, as this may lead to blisters or skin damage.

## Four: Post-treatment Guidelines

1. After removing the cup, the treated area may show red-purple discoloration, slight moisture, and a deep mark at the cup's edge with a central elevation—these are normal phenomena and will gradually fade within several hours or within 2–3 days. Keep the area clean and dry.

2. It is recommended to drink warm water to promote metabolism; avoid drinking cold water or ice-cold beverages.

3. The area may appear slightly moist or have a pool-like appearance after cupping. Do not attempt to puncture it yourself. Cover it with clean gauze and monitor it closely to prevent infection.

4. If symptoms such as fever, redness, swelling, or severe pain occur, seek medical attention immediately.

## Five: Contraindications for Cupping

1. Areas with skin ulcers or skin lesions.

2. Areas with muscle atrophy, prominent bony prominences, major blood vessels, or excessive hair growth.

3. Individuals in extreme weakness or with generalized edema.

4. Cupping is strictly prohibited on the lower abdomen, nipples, or cardiac region in pregnant women.

5. Children under six years old or elderly individuals over seventy years old should only undergo cupping after being evaluated by a doctor.

6. Patients with hemophilia or severe heart disease are not recommended to receive cupping therapy.

## Six: Common Cupping Mark Color Descriptions in Clinical Practice

1. Blue: Indicates blood stasis or pain conditions.

2. Purple: Suggests deeper disease locations and internal blood stasis.

3. Purple-black: Deep purple or bright rashes indicate severe cold-dampness or blood stasis, indicating local exposure to cold pathogenic factors leading to impaired qi and blood circulation—this is known as cold-blood stasis syndrome.

4. Bright red: A bright red mark usually indicates a heat condition, such as heatstroke, heat rash, or external wind-heat conditions.

5. Dark red: Often indicates localized or corresponding meridian/organ heat accumulation; commonly accompanied by steam or moisture inside the cup, suggesting the presence of fluid accumulation in the body or locally, which is typically associated with dampness conditions.

6. Bright red with blisters: Indicates the presence of damp-heat in the body or locally.

7. Black: Indicates a severe cold pathogen or blood stasis. A grayish and dry color suggests long-standing blood stasis and a weakened constitution. A shiny black color indicates severe cold-dampness.

If the marks, unusual sensations, or reactions gradually decrease or disappear during treatment, it indicates that the condition is improving.## VII. References
