Fumigation is an important external treatment in Traditional Chinese Medicine. By combining herbal medicine fumigation with the thermal effect of modern medical equipment, the penetration ability of the herbal medicine can be enhanced, allowing the therapeutic effects to directly reach the skin.

二、What is fumigation therapy?

The method of hot compress fumigation, historically known as "bathing with steam," involves boiling herbal medicine in a basin or pot and then using the steam to soak the affected area.

三、Benefits of fumigation

四、Indications for fumigation therapy

Conditions caused by joint and limb injuries such as stiffness, spasm, pain, bruising, numbness, and back and shoulder pain, as well as sprains and contusions. Examples include: "mother's hand," "fifty-year shoulder," and "trigger finger."

六、Shutong External Solution

Shutong External Solution is made from several traditional Chinese herbal ingredients and has therapeutic effects such as promoting blood circulation, resolving blood stasis, reducing swelling and itching, relieving muscle pain, and improving circulation in tendons and bones.

七、Precautions for fumigation therapy

(1) Clean the affected area before treatment. If there are ointments or medicated dressings, remove them first.

(2) Spray and gently rub the Shutong External Solution on the affected area, and lightly massage it.

(3) Each fumigation session should last approximately 10–15 minutes. Maintain a distance of about 30 cm; if the local area feels too hot, increase the distance to prevent overheating. The skin should turn slightly red, and during the fumigation process, avoid touching the high-temperature main unit, triangular bottles, bottle mouths, silicone tubes, or other hot surfaces to prevent burns.

(5) If the sensation in the treated area is abnormal, please inform the medical or nursing staff immediately to avoid burns.
