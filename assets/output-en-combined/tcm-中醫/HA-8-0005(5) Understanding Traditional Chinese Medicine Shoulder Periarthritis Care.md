Care for Shoulder Pain

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1118_255_1681_705.jpg" alt="Image" width="33%" /></div>Shoulder periarthritis, also known as shoulder joint periarthritis or "frozen shoulder," is commonly referred to as "stiff shoulder" or "fifty-year-old shoulder." Its formal medical name is "adhesive capsulitis."

## I. Etiological Factors

The exact cause is unclear. It primarily affects middle-aged adults in their fifties and is a general term referring to damage to soft tissues and the joint capsule. It may result from excessive force or improper movements, leading to internal tissue injury and adhesion. Over time, this causes widespread involvement of the entire joint capsule, resulting in shoulder pain, functional impairment, and restricted range of motion—such as difficulty combing hair or pulling a zipper. Patients may also wake up at night due to pain caused by pressing on the affected shoulder.

Shoulder periarthritis is divided into three stages, and the treatment principles vary according to these stages, with corresponding interventions based on the severity of symptoms.

## (1) Pain Stage:

In the early stage, pain and reduced mobility are caused by muscle spasm. The primary treatment goal is to relieve pain and prevent joint stiffness. Local pain areas can be treated using methods such as massage, cold compresses, acupuncture, or electrical stimulation. Anti-inflammatory and analgesic medications may also be taken as prescribed by a doctor.

## (2) Stiffness Stage:

Joint mobility decreases over time, and the joint gradually becomes stiff. In this stage, treatments such as acupuncture, moxibustion, and muscle manipulation can be applied at acupoints such as Shoujing (Shoulder Well), Tianzong (Sky Pivot), and Tiao Kou through Cheng Shan to alleviate joint contractures and stiffness. Exercise helps to loosen the joint and improve range of motion, while also maintaining muscle endurance. This stage is a crucial part of the treatment process.

## (3) Thawing Stage:

With traditional Chinese medicine support, patients experience significant improvement in functional ability and a marked reduction in pain. At this stage, treatments such as moxibustion and massage can be used to nourish tendons and unblock meridians, activating the surrounding shoulder tissues. However, the key lies in the patient beginning strengthening exercises and functional training to enable normal work performance in the future.

## II. Care for "Fifty-Year-Old Shoulder"

## (1) Avoid lifting heavy objects.

## (2) Moderate exercise: Exercises targeting shoulder joint mobility, such as pendulum movements and wall climbing, include:

1. Pendulum Exercise: Stand in a half-squat position. With the affected hand, swing it forward vertically twice, then perform one external rotation; swing it backward twice, then perform one internal rotation.

2. Wall Climbing Exercise: Use a wall, facing it or leaning against it, and climb upward with your fingers.

3. Scapular Movements: Include upward and forward lifting, backward lifting, and rotational movements.

4. Behind-the-Back Hand Raise: Place both hands behind the back at the waist level, with the affected hand on top and the healthy hand below. Try to lift both hands as high as possible.

5. Ear Touching Exercise: Raise the affected hand over the back and reach to touch the opposite ear, trying to touch the corner of the mouth.

## (3) Avoid improper postures: For example, suddenly raising the shoulders too high or using the upper arm as a pillow.

## (4) Perform more chest-opening and lateral raising exercises: Sitting at a desk or typing on a computer involves inward movements or internal rotation of the shoulder. Prolonged maintenance of such postures can lead to muscular imbalance in the shoulder joint. Therefore, it is recommended to perform more chest-opening and lateral raising exercises.
