<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1198_945_1626_1030.jpg" alt="Image" width="25%" /></div>Traditional Chinese medicine classifies food properties into cold, hot, warm, cool, and neutral. In daily life health care, dietary choices should vary according to the seasons—spring, summer, autumn, and winter—therefore, dietary restrictions must be tailored to individual constitutions. By understanding these differences and adjusting dietary habits according to one’s constitution, the body’s digestion and absorption can be improved, thereby achieving better internal and external physiological balance.

## One. Cold and icy foods

Ice cream, watermelon, water pear, grapefruit, pomelo, coconuts, oranges, hard persimmons, rambutan, lotus root, green beans, white radish, Chinese cabbage, bitter gourd, cucumber, luffa, winter melon, tomato, bamboo shoots, banana, green tea.

These foods should be avoided or consumed in moderation by individuals with a cold constitution, those who are prone to cold sensitivity, or those suffering from upper respiratory tract diseases or gastrointestinal dysfunction. However, individuals with a hot constitution may consume cooling foods to reduce internal heat and inflammation.

## Two. Spicy, hot, grilled, and fried foods

(1) Spicy foods: chili peppers, garlic, coriander (cilantro), old ginger, onions, sambal paste.

(2) Hot foods: fennel, leeks, cinnamon, lamb.

(3) Hot fruits: longan, lychee, mango, rambutan.

(4) Stimulating foods: pickled foods, coffee, curry, etc.

These foods may lead to symptoms such as dry mouth, throat dryness, and constipation—common signs of "heat in the body." Therefore, individuals with a hot constitution or those suffering from acute inflammatory conditions should avoid these foods.

## Three. Light, sweet, and easily digestible foods

(1) Vegetables and fruits: papaya, apple, grapes, orange, papaya, strawberry, cherry, mulberry, pumpkin, water spinach, spinach, red radish, sweet potato leaves, chives, cauliflower, potato, sweet potato, mushrooms, black fungus, silver ear fungus, yam.

(2) Animal products: chicken, fish, pork, pork bones.

(3) Grains: brown rice, millet, white rice, etc.

(4) Dairy and eggs: eggs, milk, soy milk, cheese.

These foods are neutral in nature and generally safe for most people unless there is a known allergy. They are easily digestible and well-absorbed.

## Four. Moisturizing and gelatinous foods

(1) Animal-based gelatin: chicken feet, pork feet, pork skin, beef tendon, sea cucumber, fish skin, sea cucumber skin. However, individuals with high cholesterol should avoid these.

(2) Plant-based gelatin: white fungus, black fungus, okra, chuan qi ye, palace vegetable, sweet potato leaves, yam, lotus root, chestnuts, mushrooms, sea grass, sea lettuce, etc.

## Five. Medication administration and precautions

Correct medication administration can enhance the effectiveness of the treatment.

(1) It is recommended to take medicine with warm water, and to follow the doctor’s instructions precisely.

(2) When taking both traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, there should be a one-hour gap between doses; they should not be taken simultaneously.

(3) If the doctor recommends taking *Renshen* (a tonic herb), avoid eating white radish, as white radish has digestive, phlegm-resolving, and qi-regulating effects. Since *Renshen* is a tonic, combining it with a digestive herb may counteract its therapeutic effect.

(4) Individuals with poor gastrointestinal function should avoid spicy and hot foods. Instead, they should eat small meals frequently and prefer light, easy-to-digest foods.

(5) Individuals with edema should avoid pickled or overly salty foods.

(6) People with allergic constitutions should limit their intake of seafood and nuts.

(7) Patients taking sedative or sleeping pills should avoid drinking tea. Tea should not be used as a substitute for water when taking medication, as tea contains caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline, which can stimulate the heart, promote diuresis, increase gastric acid secretion, and excite the central nervous system.

(8) Individuals with coagulation disorders, those currently taking anticoagulants, or those awaiting surgery must inform their physician of their condition.

(9) For scientific formulations of traditional Chinese medicine, store them in airtight containers at room temperature or in the refrigerator to prevent moisture damage.

(10) During the course of taking traditional Chinese medicine, it is recommended to consume light, neutral, and easily digestible foods. Foods that are cold, greasy, spicy, or hot should be avoided entirely.

In summary, each person has a different constitution. During medication, it is essential to follow the doctor’s advice regarding diet and proper medication administration. Paying attention to dietary restrictions and contraindications ensures the safety and effectiveness of clinical treatment.
