Three. Home care precautions:

The environment in Taiwan is characterized by a humid and hot climate, especially in areas with large temperature fluctuations, high population density, and severe air pollution. These conditions can trigger allergic reactions and worsen symptoms due to autonomic nervous system dysfunction.

Exposure to allergens can stimulate the body's immune response, leading to allergic rhinitis. Dust mites are the most common allergens, followed by pollen, cockroach droppings, and animal dander.

(2) Autonomic nervous system dysfunction can trigger parasympathetic reflexes, leading to symptoms such as increased vascular permeability and allergic reactions.

(1) Contact with allergens stimulates the body's immune response. In Taiwan, the incidence of allergic rhinitis is particularly high among children and adolescents, with common symptoms including sneezing, coughing, nasal congestion, runny nose, nasal itching, eye itching, dark circles under the eyes, and fatigue. In cold weather, people often sneeze or cough upon waking in the morning, or experience nasal congestion. Severe cases may also lead to drowsiness, dizziness, difficulty concentrating, and other symptoms that impair learning quality and bring significant inconvenience to daily life.
