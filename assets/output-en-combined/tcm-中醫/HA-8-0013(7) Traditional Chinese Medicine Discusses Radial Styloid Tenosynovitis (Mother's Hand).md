Traditional Chinese Medicine on Radial Styloid Tendinitis  
(Mother's Hand)"Mom's Hand": A common term for a hand condition, referring to tendinitis of the extensor pollicis brevis and abductor pollicis longus muscles. It commonly affects middle-aged women and postpartum women (e.g., holding babies, twisting towels), or certain occupations such as food service delivery workers (e.g., carrying trays). This condition results from improper force applied to the thumb and wrist, leading to inflammation.

## I. Symptoms of Mom's Hand

Common symptoms include tightness, stiffness, and pain at the base of the thumb near the wrist. Pain intensifies when the thumb is extended or bent, or when the wrist is deviated toward the little finger side.

## II. Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatment

Treatment for Mom's Hand can be divided into two parts:

(1) Traditional acupuncture points, which can be categorized into local (proximal) points and distant points. Most journal articles mention acupuncture at local wrist-area points such as Hegu (LI4), Yangxi (LI5), Yanglingquan (GB34), or points on the elbow such as Quchi (LI11) and Shousanli (LI10). Distant points are typically selected according to meridian pathways and can help regulate local blood and qi circulation, such as Zusanli (ST36) and Yanglingquan (GB34).

(2) Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatment

By integrating modern anatomical understanding of muscles and fascia with acupuncture therapy, treatment focuses on relaxing both local and long-range muscles and ligaments.

## III. Prevention

(1) If your work involves prolonged computer use, avoid keeping your wrist in extended or bent positions for long periods. Take short breaks and perform stretching exercises in between to prevent increased pressure in the carpal tunnel. When typing, apply light pressure on the keys. When using a mouse, if your wrist needs to bend, place a rolled towel under your forearm to maintain the wrist in a neutral position.

(2) When lifting or carrying objects, avoid bending your wrist and overusing your fingers to reduce the risk of developing Mom's Hand or injury to the triangular fibrocartilage.

(3) When performing actions involving hand support or pushing, use a wrist brace to limit the degree of wrist extension, thereby protecting the triangular fibrocartilage.
