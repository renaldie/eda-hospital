## Understanding Traditional Chinese Postpartum RecoveryPostpartum care, commonly known as "sitting the moon," is essential for both natural childbirth and cesarean section mothers. During labor, women experience physical trauma and bleeding, resulting in significant depletion of energy and qi. Postpartum, their bodies are often characterized by deficiency and blood stasis, requiring a period of time to restore internal organs to their pre-pregnancy state. During this period, mothers must pay special attention to their diet and lifestyle, and incorporate appropriate medicinal foods to aid in physical recovery. Tailoring postpartum care according to individual constitution can effectively prevent common postpartum issues such as lower back pain, joint pain, hair loss, and insufficient milk supply.

## One: Is it necessary to drink Sheng Hua Tang during the postpartum period?

Sheng Hua Tang not only promotes uterine contractions and helps expel lochia, but more importantly, it enhances the removal of blood clots and prevents postpartum infections. The composition of Sheng Hua Tang can vary in proportion, resulting in different therapeutic effects. Therefore, a personalized postpartum prescription should be formulated by a qualified physician, combined with appropriate medicinal diets, to help mothers recover quickly to their pre-pregnancy health.

## Two: Is "mango oil chicken" the holy food of postpartum care?

Mango oil chicken is a traditional medicinal dish commonly consumed by Taiwanese women after childbirth. However, it is not suitable for all mothers. For instance, those with a constitution prone to internal heat should use bitter leaf oil instead of mango oil.

## Three: Dietary guidelines for postpartum care and acupressure to promote milk production:

1. The main difference between vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery lies in wound care. For cesarean delivery, attention should be paid to wound healing. If there is no redness, swelling, or pain, mango oil chicken and alcoholic beverages may be consumed starting from two weeks postpartum, depending on the wound condition.

2. Maintain a balanced diet and follow a traditional Chinese medicine prescription tailored to individual constitution.

3. Dietary recommendations for different stages after vaginal delivery:

(Note: Cesarean delivery timeline is delayed by one week)

(1) Days 1–7: Focus on clearing lochia and promoting wound healing. Consume light, neutral foods with high nutritional value, such as chicken soup, fish soup, and pork bone soup. However, alcohol should be avoided.

(2) Days 7–13: Focus on promoting uterine contractions and preventing lower back and back pain. Incorporate foods prepared with mango oil and Eucommia, such as mango oil stir-fried pig liver.

(3) After day 14: Focus on replenishing nutrition and restoring physical strength. Mango oil chicken can be introduced at this stage.

4. To promote milk production, in addition to dietary supplementation, breast massage can be performed, and the following acupoints can also be massaged:

(1) Zhongwan point: Located in the midline between the two nipples.

(2) Shaozhe point: Located on the ulnar side of the tip of the little finger, 1 cun from the nail corner.

(3) Zusanli point: Located in the depression on the outer side of the knee, four finger-widths away from the knee joint. These acupoints should be pressed with the palm, 2–3 times daily, for 3–5 minutes until a sensation of soreness or heaviness is felt.

## Four: Balanced Diet After Childbirth

1. Vegetables and root/stem vegetables: Carrots, bok choy, water spinach, spinach, celery, red amaranth, yam, etc.

2. Fruits: Apple, papaya, grapes, papaya, strawberries, cherries, watermelon, etc.

3. Protein sources: Pork, beef, chicken, lamb, eggs, pork stomach, pork heart, pork feet, pork liver, etc.

## Five: Dietary Restrictions

1. Avoid cold and cool foods: Ice cream, pears, pomelos, watermelons, coconuts, oranges, green beans, lotus root, cucumber, bitter gourd, loofah, winter melon, and lotus fruit.

2. Avoid roasted, fried, spicy, and stimulating foods: Pickled foods, coffee, curry, chili peppers, strong tea, etc.

3. Limit acidic foods: Sour jujube, vinegar, lemon, etc.

4. Avoid overly salty foods.

5. Prefer warm and thoroughly cooked foods.

6. Avoid mango oil and alcohol-based dishes if there is redness, swelling, pain, or signs of internal heat at the wound site.

7. Only consume shrimp and red shrimp after the wound has fully healed.
