## Traditional Chinese Medicine Care for Gastroesophageal Reflux

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1345_801_1543_997.jpg" alt="Image" width="11%" /></div>Gastroesophageal reflux is a common ailment among modern people, closely related to dietary habits, obesity, stress, and emotions. Typical and atypical symptoms are as follows:

## Typical Symptoms

- **Gastroesophageal reflux**: No nausea or vomiting, but gastric fluid flows upward into the mouth. People often wake up at night due to acidic fluid flowing from the stomach to the throat.

- **Burning sensation in the chest or heartburn**: A burning or painful sensation from the upper left abdomen (where the stomach is located) to the neck area, commonly occurring 1–2 hours after meals, especially after overeating or consuming excessive food.

## Atypical Symptoms

- **Chest tightness or chest pain (pain located between the stomach or lower chest and the neck)**: Chest pain is often mistakenly attributed to cardiovascular or thoracic issues. It is essential to rule out internal organ diseases before considering gastroesophageal reflux as a possible cause.

- **Bad breath**: Gastric fluid reflux stimulates salivary glands to secrete large amounts of saliva, resulting in a bitter, salty, or sour taste in the mouth. Gastric fluid may also erode the gums, causing inflammation or dry mouth, worsening the problem of bad breath.

- **Chronic cough**: Small amounts of gastric acid can stimulate the trachea, causing coughing; or gastric acid can stimulate the nerves at the lower end of the esophagus, triggering reflexive coughing.

- **Laryngopharyngeal reflux (laryngopharyngeal syndrome)**: Gastric acid flows into the trachea or vocal cords and cannot be expelled, leading to a sensation of something stuck in the throat, hoarseness, and frequent clearing of the throat.

- **Burping**: After eating, the time required for digestion increases. Initially, gas is expelled; later, the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes, allowing gas to accumulate in the stomach, resulting in gastroesophageal reflux symptoms.

## Three. Dietary Recommendations and Restrictions

## (1) Suitable Foods:

1. Low-fat or skim milk or cold-processed pasteurized milk.

2. Fresh fruits and vegetables.

3. Foods that benefit the stomach: such as black fungus, mountain yam, okra, pumpkin, papaya, etc., while paying attention to a balanced diet.

## (2) Foods to Avoid:

1. Spicy and stimulating foods: chili peppers, onions, acidic juices, coffee, etc.

2. Gas-producing foods: beans and bean products, cabbage, corn, french fries, sweet potatoes, onions, carrots, buns, bread, which may cause bloating and trigger gastroesophageal reflux.

3. Foods that cause gastrointestinal motility discomfort: chocolate, sweets, mint, oranges, grapefruit, foods containing tomatoes, whole milk, high-fat foods (such as fried chicken legs, fried fish, french fries, oily rice), and processed foods.

4. Difficult-to-digest foods: such as rice balls, zongzi, mochi, sweet cakes, and rice cakes, which may increase gastric burden and lead to digestive-related stomach pain.

(3) Distribute daily water intake evenly (approximately 2000 ml/day), but avoid drinking large amounts of water or soup before or during meals, as this may dilute gastric acid and stimulate the body to secrete more gastric acid.

## Four. Daily Health Care

(1) Do not lie down immediately after eating or sleep in a supine or prone position. It is recommended to elevate the head of the bed by 15–20 cm using a pillow. Avoid lying down immediately after meals; instead, wait at least 2–3 hours before going to bed.

(2) Develop a regular exercise routine, preferably two hours after meals, to aid digestion and maintain a healthy weight.

(3) Limit intake of strongly stimulating medications, such as painkillers (especially those containing opioid components), oral contraceptives, and calcium channel blockers (hypertension medications).

(4) Reduce abdominal pressure: avoid constipation or wearing tight clothing or belts that compress the abdomen.

(5) Identify sources of stress and manage emotions, as stress can lead to excessive gastric acid secretion and worsen gastroesophageal reflux, creating a vicious cycle.

## Five. Acupressure on Traditional Chinese Medicine Points

(1) Neiguan point: Located on the inner side of the forearm, at the midpoint of the transverse crease of the wrist, about 3 finger-widths up along the middle of the two tendons. This point can help relieve and prevent gastroesophageal reflux, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting.
