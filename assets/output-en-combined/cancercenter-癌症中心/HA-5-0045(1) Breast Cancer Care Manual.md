## Plastic Surgery Breast Reconstruction

Breasts are one of the most important secondary sexual characteristics for women. Breast cancer patients not only face the physical and psychological impact of the disease, but also endure the sudden and drastic change caused by breast removal, which brings immense psychological shock and suffering.

Research shows that breast reconstruction following mastectomy can significantly improve patients' need for a complete body image, helping them recover quickly from the pain of cancer treatment, regain confidence and freedom, and maintain their quality of life after cancer diagnosis.

Role distribution between breast surgery and plastic surgery in breast cancer treatment:

## Breast Surgery

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1_575_876_946.jpg" alt="Image" width="99%" /></div>

The choice of reconstruction method often depends on the amount of skin and tissue that can be preserved post-surgery, and the most suitable method is selected after comprehensive consideration.## 10 Breast Reconstruction Surgery in Plastic Surgery

## Special Features of Plastic Surgery Breast Reconstruction at the Cancer Treatment Hospital of Taichung

### 1. Latissimus Dorsi Myocutaneous Flap + Silicone Gel Implant Placement

After breast tissue removal, insufficient soft tissue often leads to capsule contracture when implants are placed, resulting in asymmetry between the two breasts in height or shape. The Plastic Surgery Department at the Cancer Treatment Hospital of Taichung has developed a technique using the latissimus dorsi muscle to supplement the deficient soft tissue of the breast, followed by placing the implant within the soft tissue envelope to achieve a soft, balanced, and symmetrical reconstructed breast.

### 2. Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous Flap (TRAM) Procedure

The TRAM procedure utilizes excess abdominal fat and abdominal wall tissue from the lower abdomen to reconstruct the breast, creating a natural-looking breast appearance. Compared to implant-based reconstruction, the TRAM procedure offers the advantage of providing sufficient soft tissue coverage for the chest.

## Preoperative Lymphatic-Venous Anastomosis in Breast Cancer Surgery

A study published in 2017 in the *Annals of Surgical Oncology* reported that over a 10-year follow-up of 1,794 patients, the overall incidence of lymphedema following breast cancer surgery within five years was 9.1%. Among patients who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy, the incidence of lymphedema was 5.3%, whereas among those who underwent axillary lymph node dissection, it reached 15.9%. When radiotherapy was also administered, the risk increased by a factor of two.

With the advancement of surgical and medical techniques, breast cancer is becoming more prevalent among younger patients, yet cure rates remain high. Consequently, the number of patients developing lymphedema is also increasing.

In 2014, Dr. Boccardo from Italy published a study in an international journal, tracking 74 patients who underwent LYMPHA surgery during breast cancer treatment for four years. The incidence of lymphedema was reduced to 4.05%. In 2019, a study by Johnson and colleagues from Harvard Medical School compared the incidence of lymphedema across different stages with and without intraoperative LYMPHA:

a. Mastectomy + axillary lymph node dissection: lymphedema incidence of 14.1%.

b. Mastectomy + axillary lymph node dissection + radiotherapy-induced lymphedema: incidence of 33.4%.

c. Mastectomy + axillary lymph node dissection + LYMPHA: lymphedema incidence reduced to 2.1%.

d. Mastectomy + axillary lymph node dissection + radiotherapy + LYMPHA: lymphedema incidence reduced to 10.3%.

Literature confirms that this surgical approach is effective in preventing the occurrence of lymphedema.## Prosthetic Passport

## Postoperative bras

Patients who undergo breast-conserving surgery can wear bras after surgery. If the incision is at the lower edge of the breast, it is recommended to wear sports bras without underwire. Patients who undergo total mastectomy, due to the presence of drainage tubes, should wear specialized postoperative bras.

For the first week after surgery, avoid pulling or tugging, and refrain from lifting or exerting force. Choose loose-fitting clothing with front closures or zippers.

In the initial phase after surgery, wear postoperative bras for 24 hours a day. Wear them for 3 to 6 months, after which they can be alternated with regular bras as a form of maintenance.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_77_462_813_781.jpg" alt="Image" width="84%" /></div>

1. After surgery, get up and move around as soon as possible once conscious, but avoid falling or getting injured.

2. After surgery, perform deep breathing and coughing exercises to promote lung expansion and prevent respiratory complications.

3. When lying flat, use a pillow to elevate the affected arm above heart level to promote venous and lymphatic return, reducing swelling in the arm.

4. After suture removal, apply paper tape tightly for 1 to 3 months to enhance wound closure and provide support.

5. During chemotherapy or radiotherapy, the skin is more sensitive; avoid sun exposure. When going out during the day, wear long-sleeved clothing or use an umbrella to block direct sunlight.## Post-surgical wound care

## Things to avoid

1. No treatment on the affected side for 1–2 months, such as blood pressure measurement, blood drawing, or injections.

2. Avoid lifting objects heavier than 5 kilograms or hanging heavy objects on the affected shoulder during the first 1–2 months to prevent injury.

## Precautions

Seek medical attention immediately if any of the following symptoms occur:

1. Large amounts of fresh red drainage

2. Abnormal secretions from the wound

3. Subcutaneous hematoma that is expanding

4. Wound dehiscence

5. Body temperature > 38.5℃## Red Passport

## Post-surgical wound care

## Drainage tube volume recording

Hospital nurses will provide you with a small measuring cup with graduations to record the volume and color of the drainage fluid. Please record the volume and color accurately, and then pour it down the toilet to flush it away. When you return for follow-up, please bring the registration form with you. Your doctor will use your records to decide whether to remove the drainage tube. If the drainage volume gradually decreases, the doctor will remove the drainage tube based on the wound healing condition.

## Introduction to the Implantable Injection Port (Port-A)

## I. What is the Implantable Injection Port (Port-A):

Port-A (venous access implantable port, Port-A) is commonly known as an artificial vein. It is a synthetic silicone device composed of two parts: a spherical section and a catheter. It features an injection port and a catheter with a locking mechanism (Figure 1). The catheter is approximately 70 cm long (about 15–20 cm when implanted inside the body), extending from the subclavian vein through the superior vena cava to the upper part of the right atrium. The injection site is implanted into the subcutaneous tissue of the chest wall beneath the clavicle, thus not interfering with daily life. It appears as a small bump, roughly the size of a 10-yuan coin (Figure 2).

## II. How is the Implantable Injection Port (Port-A) installed:

Generally, patients can be admitted to the hospital or receive outpatient treatment under local or general anesthesia. A small incision of about 4–5 cm is made below the clavicle. The catheter is inserted into the central vein from a peripheral vein, and then the injection port is implanted beneath the skin.

## III. Why is the Implantable Injection Port (Port-A) installed and what are its benefits:

Patients receiving long-term chemotherapy often experience vein thrombosis or vein hardening, which increases the difficulty of injections and causes physical and psychological discomfort. If chemotherapy drugs accidentally leak, it may lead to local tissue and vascular necrosis.

The Port-A is specifically designed for patients requiring long-term and repeated drug administration. It eliminates the pain and inconvenience of repeated intravenous injections, making it both safe and convenient. It can be used for drug injections or continuous infusion, blood draws for laboratory testing, and even for the administration of blood products, nutrition, or other liquids.## Pink Passport

## Post-surgical wound care

Introduction and overview of the implantable injection port (port-A)

Four: Daily self-care for the implantable injection port (port-A):

1. After surgery, a cosmetic adhesive will be applied to the incision site and covered with sterile gauze. The cosmetic adhesive does not need to be changed—just let it naturally fall off. However, daily check for signs of redness, swelling, heat, pain, or excessive discharge or bleeding should be performed; if any of these symptoms occur, it may indicate infection, and you should immediately return to see your doctor for evaluation.

2. On the day of surgery, your doctor will schedule a follow-up appointment. During the time at home, use a wiping method when bathing; only after your doctor evaluates and confirms wound healing can you switch to showering.

3. There are no activity restrictions, but avoid intense physical activities. For the arm on the same side as the artificial vessel, avoid full 360-degree rotation, lifting objects over 4.5 kilograms, direct impacts or pressure on the protruding area, to prevent displacement of the artificial vessel.

4. If the artificial vessel is not in use, it must be regularly reviewed every 1–2 months or as needed; after approval, visit the injection room where the port will be flushed once with normal saline containing anticoagulant (Heparin) to prevent catheter blockage.

5. Pay attention to the backflow of the artificial vessel each time, as this provides important information for your doctor or nurse to assess the function of the artificial vessel in the next visit.

## Care Guidelines for Radiation Therapy in Breast Cancer

Radiation therapy is an essential component of adjuvant treatment following breast cancer surgery. The principle of radiation therapy is to use high-energy X-rays or particle beams to destroy cancer cells, thereby reducing the risk of recurrence in the affected breast. Radiation therapy is typically administered once per day, five days a week, with each session lasting about five to ten minutes. The treatment course usually ranges from three to four weeks for shorter regimens, and up to five to six weeks for longer ones. Although there is no pain, warmth, or electric shock sensation during each treatment session, and the body does not retain any residual radioactivity, the skin in the treated area may gradually develop varying degrees of skin reactions known as radiation dermatitis.

## Generally, it is divided into four grades:

Grade 1: Mild localized redness and dry peeling.

Grade 2: Wider redness and small areas of moist peeling limited to skin folds.

Grade 3: Large areas of moist peeling appear outside the skin folds, possibly accompanied by bleeding.

Grade 4: Skin necrosis and ulceration, spontaneous bleeding, and potentially life-threatening complications.

Starting from the second or third week after treatment, the skin may gradually darken and become slightly red, similar to the changes caused by prolonged sun exposure. The acute skin inflammation caused by radiation is temporary and will gradually resolve within two to four weeks after the completion of therapy. Most skin reactions are mild, such as localized redness and peeling, while only a few patients experience more severe reactions.

Prevention is better than treatment, so how to alleviate radiation dermatitis is a key focus in radiation therapy. The primary principles of skin care during radiation therapy are to maintain cleanliness, preserve skin integrity, and promote comfort.# Pink Passport

## Radiation Therapy

## Principles of Care to Prevent Radiation Dermatitis

## (1) Maintain Skin Cleanliness

Keep the irradiated skin area clean and dry as much as possible. Avoid bathing, swimming, or soaking in hot springs. A shower with water below 40°C is sufficient. Use a soap or body wash specifically formulated for sensitive skin with a weakly acidic pH (4–6) and free from fragrances. Gently clean the irradiated skin area and pat it dry with a towel using light pressure, avoiding rubbing.

## (2) Maintain Skin Integrity

Avoid massaging the irradiated skin area or any rubbing, scratching, or rubbing motions. Do not apply adhesive bandages to the irradiated area.

Wear loose, soft clothing and avoid wearing bras to reduce skin friction. Avoid carrying bags on the affected side; instead, cross your arms over your chest to reduce friction in the armpit area.

Cover the treated area with clothing to prevent direct exposure to sunlight.

Avoid using razors to shave the area directly. Instead, use an electric shaver.

## (3) Promote Comfort

Reduce sweating to avoid skin irritation from sweat.

Avoid using baby powder or cornstarch in skin creases.

Avoid using skin products containing irritating ingredients such as alcohol, fragrances, or alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs).

Oily products such as petroleum jelly, baby oil, or sheep oil are difficult to clean and should be avoided during irradiation.

Antiperspirants containing or not containing metal components may be used if necessary.## (Four) Other Preventive Measures

(Four) Other preventive measures

Topical application of moderate to weak potency corticosteroids (betamethasone and mometasone) has been shown in current studies to reduce the incidence of severe radiation dermatitis and may be used temporarily under a doctor's prescription. Alternatively, silicone-based gel dressings may be considered. After natural drying, they form a transparent, resilient protective layer, and small-scale studies have demonstrated their ability to reduce the occurrence of radiation dermatitis.

Aloe vera may worsen the severity of radiation dermatitis and is therefore advised against use.

Other skincare products currently lack sufficient evidence from evidence-based medicine to demonstrate preventive effects against radiation dermatitis. If use is desired, consultation with a physician is recommended.

## Rehabilitation Exercises

## Post-surgical lymphedema

Causes:  
1. Damage or dysfunction of lymphatic vessels or lymph nodes, leading to impaired transport capacity.  
2. Protein deposition in interstitial tissues, increasing tissue osmotic pressure, which makes water easily retained in the interstitial spaces.

Incidence: The incidence of lymphedema in the arm is 8.4%–21.4%.

## International Lymphatic Society Staging

| Stage | Symptoms | Management |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Stage 0 | Reduced transport capacity. | — |
| Stage I | Pitting edema present but reversible. | Elevate the limb, edema will subside |
| Stage IV | Elevating the limb is ineffective, with tissue fibrosis, skin thickening and hardening. | Comprehensive decongestive therapy |
| Stage III | Tissue inflammatory response, elephantiasis, decreased immunity, fungal infections between fingernails. | Surgery may be required |## Skin Care

## What to do

1. Protect the skin and prevent dryness  
2. Wear elastic gloves when flying  
3. Wear loose-fitting clothing

## Manual Lymphatic Drainage

Purpose of manual lymphatic drainage:

Softens subcutaneous tissue, reduces protein deposition, improves subcutaneous fibrosis, promotes lateral lymphatic branching, and redirects stagnant lymph to normal, undamaged lymphatic territories.

Manual lymphatic drainage must be performed by a professionally trained therapist. Therefore, when lymphedema occurs, it is recommended to visit the rehabilitation department for evaluation by a physician, after which a physical therapist will carry out lymphatic drainage.

## Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatment for Breast Cancer

## Application of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Cancer Chemotherapy

In cancer treatment, chemotherapy drugs can directly inhibit or kill cancer cells. However, many chemotherapy drugs lack selectivity and cause damage to the body, leading to side effects such as those affecting the hematopoietic system, immune system, digestive system, and nervous system. Some drugs also exhibit delayed toxicities. According to the traditional Chinese medical principle of "strengthening the body's defenses and eliminating pathogenic factors," using herbal medicine to regulate the body can enhance therapeutic efficacy and reduce side effects.

## Dietary and Nutritional Guidance Principles for Cancer Patients in Traditional Chinese Medicine

Cancer patients should consume food that is easy to digest, nutritious, and light, avoiding excessive intake of rich or greasy foods. Breast cancer patients should avoid high-fat (especially animal fats) and high-animal-protein foods.

## Avoid Consuming Foods Containing Carcinogens

1. Unfresh or long-stored foods, as well as foods containing nitrites  
2. Moldy foods containing mycotoxins, such as grains and their processed products  
3. Smoked or barbecued foods  
4. Foods containing artificial food additives  
5. Crops grown with heavy pesticide use during cultivation

## Pay Attention to Protecting Spleen and Stomach Function

1. Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy can all damage the spleen and stomach  
2. Overeating or undereating can harm the spleen and stomach  
3. Large doses of prolonged use of bitter-cold traditional Chinese herbal medicines can also damage the spleen and stomach  

*For cancer patients, if spleen and stomach function decline (i.e., "stomach qi" weakens), it indicates significant treatment challenges. It is recommended to receive customized traditional Chinese medicine-based supportive care after treatment, which can help improve quality of life and treatment outcomes.*## 58 Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatment for Breast Cancer

## Emphasis on Combining Strengthening the Body's Vital Energy with Eliminating Pathogenic Factors

1. When undergoing surgical, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy—treatments aimed at attacking cancerous factors—supplementary traditional Chinese herbal medicine to strengthen the body's vital energy is essential. In addition, nutritional support is also important. For example, mushrooms contain lentinan, which can enhance the immune function of cancer patients. Carrots, tomatoes, and pumpkins contain beta-carotene, vitamin C, and trace elements such as zinc, manganese, and copper, all of which have antioxidant properties. Green vegetables are rich in vitamin C. Garlic and onions have strong antibacterial and anticancer effects.

2. Choose vegetables and herbs that are both food and have anticancer properties, such as horse radish, golden needle flowers, yam, walnuts, nori, seaweed, water caltrop, lotus seeds, taro, and lotus root.

## Pay Attention to the Nature and Functions of Foods—Apply Food Therapy According to Individual Constitution

*The Golden Chamber of Medical Essentials*: "The types of food consumed may either be suitable for the illness or harmful to the body. If appropriate, they benefit the body; if not, they cause illness." Moldy foods that contain mycotoxins should be avoided.

1. Individuals with excessive yang heat should avoid foods such as longan, lychee, and lamb, which are warming in nature. Instead, they should consume cooling foods.

2. People with a deficient and cold constitution should avoid cold and cooling foods such as watermelon, mung beans, and cucumbers. Instead, they should consume warming foods.

3. Individuals with yin deficiency should avoid spicy foods such as chili, garlic, and ginger. Instead, they should consume nourishing yin foods such as black fungus, black beans, black dates, black mulberry seeds, snow ear, watermelon (feng shui type), lotus root, and yam.

4. Consult a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner to determine your constitution and identify suitable foods. Regular follow-ups are recommended to adjust dietary choices appropriately.## Initial Red Passport

## Traditional Chinese Health-Enhancing Medicinal Foods

## Dietary Restrictions (Abstaining from Certain Foods)

1. Cancer patients do not have strict dietary restrictions, but it is not recommended to consume "trigger foods."

2. What are "trigger foods"?

Refers to spicy, dry, hot, stimulating, rich, greasy, and heavy foods, as well as certain sea products.

Fowl, pig's head meat, lamb, shrimp, crab, mussels, tobacco, and alcohol can stimulate wind and heat, triggering chronic diseases, residual phlegm, sores, swellings, and epilepsy.

Shrimp, crab, and fish without scales are prone to causing allergic reactions.

3. Dietary restrictions should not be overly strict, and the diet should not be too narrow. It should be adjusted according to the strength of the spleen and stomach's digestive and absorptive functions, as well as the nature of the illness—whether it is cold, heat, deficiency, or excess—by providing appropriate food supplementation and dietary therapy.

## Dietary Recommendations

1. Reduce intake of animal saturated fats and omega-6 fatty acids (corn oil, soybean oil, and sunflower oil), and replace them with omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil and canola oil) and omega-9 fatty acids (olive oil, canola oil, bitter tea oil, and peanut oil).

2. Reduce consumption of red meat and prefer deep-sea fish instead.

3. Limit intake of full-fat dairy products and switch to low-fat or fat-free dairy products.

4. Increase consumption of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and nuts to enhance intake of dietary fiber, vitamins A, C, E, and carotenoids—antioxidants (dietary fiber helps eliminate female hormones in the body, reducing the concentration of female hormones in the blood).

5. Limit alcohol consumption.

6. Maintain regular sleep patterns and engage in regular physical activity.## Chemotherapy Patients - Nutritional Medicinal Foods

Chemotherapy patients often experience weakened immune function, gastrointestinal disturbances, suppression of hematopoietic function, and other physiological imbalances. In the concept of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) health care, seeking medicinal dietary supplements to improve patients' quality of life is an essential component of complementary therapies in both traditional and Western medicine.

During chemotherapy, patients commonly experience gastrointestinal reactions (such as nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite) and bone marrow suppression (such as reduced white blood cells and anemia). In dietary management, it is important to focus on stimulating appetite and consuming nutrient-rich foods.

It is recommended to consume foods that strengthen the spleen and stomach and nourish bones and marrow, such as: yam, job's tears, hawthorn, malt, citrus fruits, lion's mane mushroom, shiitake mushrooms, radish, eggs, and black fungus.

Additionally, foods that tonify qi and blood should be included, such as: red tea, goji berries, red beans, walnuts, lotus seeds, spinach, and longan meat. Avoid foods with strong fishy or pungent flavors.

## Characteristics of Chemotherapy Medicinal Foods

Combining food with medicinal herbs can promote physical health and also have preventive and therapeutic effects. Therefore, chemotherapy medicinal foods are also known as anti-cancer medicinal foods. The ingredients of chemotherapy medicinal foods consist of both food and traditional Chinese herbal medicines. Beyond improving taste, these components complement each other and enhance therapeutic efficacy.## Pink Passport

## Debunking Dietary Myths

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_20_563_71_616.jpg" alt="Image" width="5%" /></div>


## Which foods should be avoided?

Cancer patients should consume a balanced and sufficient diet, rather than restricting their food intake. Excessive dietary restrictions may lead to malnutrition, interrupting treatment, impairing the body's ability to self-repair, or causing difficulties in drug efficacy.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_9_847_61_899.jpg" alt="Image" width="5%" /></div>


## Duck meat and shellfish are more toxic; cancer patients should not eat them

Duck meat, seafood, and meats such as beef, mutton, pork, chicken, fish, and eggs all belong to the "bean, fish, egg, meat" category and are all protein-rich foods that help wound healing and boost immunity. It is recommended to choose lean cuts of meat without skin, and to avoid processed meats (such as sausages and ham).## 74 Nutrition Education

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_20_133_75_182.jpg" alt="Image" width="6%" /></div>


## Can soy and soy products be consumed?

Studies in Asian countries have found that consuming soy products can reduce the incidence and recurrence rates of breast cancer. It is safe to consume moderate amounts of natural foods (such as soy milk and tofu). High-dose soy isoflavone supplements are not recommended.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_15_383_70_433.jpg" alt="Image" width="6%" /></div>


## Does eating too little nutrition cause tumors to grow faster?

Trying to control cancer cells by eating less nutritious food instead results in starving oneself. Not only do cancer cells survive, but the individual also becomes progressively underweight, weakening their immunity and allowing cancer cells to spread more rapidly.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_11_641_66_692.jpg" alt="Image" width="6%" /></div>


## Is raw food diet better?

Most raw food diets emphasize raw foods (with high bacterial counts). During treatment, when white blood cell counts are low and immunity is weakened, individuals are more prone to diarrhea and infections. Raw food diets should be avoided during treatment.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_8_899_61_950.jpg" alt="Image" width="6%" /></div>


## Cancer cells love sugar — avoid starch?

Natural foods contain "carbohydrates," which break down into glucose and fructose in the digestive system. These are the energy source for all cells in the body. Moderate intake of carbohydrate-rich foods, including whole grains, dairy, and fruits, is recommended. Avoid excessive intake of "refined sugars," which are added sugars used during food or beverage processing.## Follow-up Record $ ^{75} $

Nutrition Department## Psychological Adaptation

Facing cancer brings a significant threat to life, posing a major impact on both the body and mind. In the early stages of diagnosis, unfamiliarity with the disease, fear and anxiety, and the invasive treatments during diagnosis and therapy can lead to feelings of anxiety and suffering. However, since the situation is life-threatening, many considerations must be made, and each person's circumstances differ.

## Initial Psychological Reactions to Cancer Diagnosis

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_23_433_87_532.jpg" alt="Image" width="7%" /></div>

## Denial

A cancer diagnosis, which is unexpected, brings life closer to the unknown and death. This often makes patients and their family and friends unable to accept it at first, and some may even question whether they truly have cancer. Some may insist on returning to their previous lives and avoid treatment altogether.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_24_676_89_771.jpg" alt="Image" width="7%" /></div>

## Anger

When a diagnosis is confirmed, treatment options are chosen, and treatment begins, feelings of anger may emerge. This is often accompanied by emotions such as fear, loneliness, and sadness. Due to cultural taboos, these emotions—especially anger—are suppressed, making it difficult to relieve them.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_29_915_89_1012.jpg" alt="Image" width="6%" /></div>

## Bargaining

Whether or not one has religious beliefs, people may often plead with heaven, asking if this entire situation could just be a bad dream.## Psychological Adjustment

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_14_148_101_252.jpg" alt="Image" width="9%" /></div>

## Despair

During this phase, patients may feel completely unmotivated about life and unable to perceive the meaning of life. However, such a state helps patients temporarily isolate themselves from external stimuli during difficult moments in life, until their mindset improves and they find turning points within their struggles and gradually move out of this phase.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_36_399_95_494.jpg" alt="Image" width="6%" /></div>

## Acceptance

This refers to patients acknowledging the real losses they have experienced as a result of this life-altering event. It requires genuine self-reflection, as no one knows better than oneself what extent of acceptance is possible. "Acceptance" itself is not a definable endpoint, but can also be a spiritual state.

By understanding the five stages of cancer-related psychological responses, the goal is not to label patients' emotional states, but rather to provide a somewhat structured model that helps us recognize where we currently are in the process. Recognizing that many others have gone through similar experiences and feelings may allow us to approach our own situation with a calmer mindset, to assess our own resources, and to begin thinking about what we can do for ourselves. This requires us to choose courage and wisdom, to reflect thoughtfully upon our current circumstances.

When you turn inward, you might, for a brief moment, see a real and unfamiliar version of yourself within the surgical wound. The things flowing through your blood are no longer just chemical agents—they may become the courage to face life and death.

You are not becoming fearful; you are simply becoming more aware of the preciousness of life. Others may no longer understand you, but you have the opportunity to know yourself better.## Mood Thermometer

I have been diagnosed with cancer. I feel unexpected anxiety, sadness, depression, disturbed sleep, and difficulty falling or staying asleep. My physical appearance has changed. Will society accept me? Will my relationships with family and close friends change? I have many worries and don't know how to bring them up.

## What is Cancer-Related Fatigue?

A subjective state of persistent, unrelenting exhaustion that affects the body, mind, and spirit, which cannot be recovered through rest. It often persists even after treatment ends.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_20_466_75_517.jpg" alt="Image" width="6%" /></div>


## Difference from Ordinary Fatigue

Cancer-related fatigue is an abnormal or excessive state of generalized tiredness that cannot be relieved by sleep. Fatigue may be acute (lasting one month or less) or chronic (lasting one to six months or more). Regardless of duration, such fatigue often impacts patients' daily work and quality of life.

## Has Cancer-Related Fatigue Struck You?

Approximately 80% of cancer patients experience fatigue symptoms, especially those undergoing treatment. The causes of fatigue are complex and may involve biological, psychological, or behavioral factors.

If you have any of the following sensations, you may be experiencing cancer-related fatigue: tiredness, exhaustion, lack of strength, inability to move, lack of energy, weakness, drowsiness, depression, slowness of movement, and a feeling of physical heaviness.

## Taiwan Version of the Brief Fatigue Scale Test

Simply think about the following three questions:

1. Do you currently feel tired or fatigued?

2. If yes, select a score from 0 to 10 (0 means completely not tired, 10 means the most fatigued state imaginable) to describe your daily fatigue level.

3. Does this fatigue affect your daily functioning (e.g., work, household chores)?

You can use the "Taiwan Version of the Brief Fatigue Scale Test" to help yourself understand the current status and impact of cancer-related fatigue.

## How to Improve Cancer Fatigue

According to the *Clinical Treatment Guidelines for Cancer-Related Fatigue*, the following five solutions are provided:

## Exercise

Set exercise content and intensity based on the patient's condition and preferences. Warm-up and cool-down exercises of 5 minutes each before and after exercise are essential.

## Psychological and Social Interventions and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

Psychological education and counseling can enhance patients' abilities to manage anxiety, depression, and psychological distress, thereby improving fatigue.

## Improve Sleep

Sleep therapy often requires medication assistance. Patients can request medication from healthcare providers based on their sleep conditions.

## Nutritional Management

Track one's nutritional status and discuss it with a dietitian as needed to supplement nutrition and prevent body supply-demand imbalance leading to fatigue.

## Complementary Therapies

Therapies such as massage and acupuncture can alleviate discomfort caused by fatigue. However, it is recommended to consult a doctor before using them.84

## Psychological Adaptation

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) provides seven recommendations for cancer patients to begin improving their fatigue issues by adjusting their lifestyle.

Try to remain physically active; walking is particularly suitable for cancer patients, and it's even better if you can develop a habit.

Take timely breaks, but avoid overdoing it—for example, a nap of less than 30 minutes is a good option.

Conserve energy and ensure that the most important daily tasks are prioritized.

## National Health Insurance - Major Illness Certificate

As long as it is confirmed that one has cancer (with histopathological reports confirming malignant tumors), and after assistance from the hospital to obtain a major illness card, the card will be directly recorded on the health insurance IC card.

To alleviate the medical expenses burden for patients with serious illnesses, Article 48 of the National Health Insurance Act stipulates that insured individuals will be exempt from out-of-pocket costs for emergency and outpatient visits when receiving treatment due to major illnesses.

If you have any questions regarding major illness certification, you may inquire at the hospital where you are receiving treatment or at local health insurance service offices. For information on application and renewal procedures, please refer to:

## Workers' Compensation - Disability Benefits

When workers suffer occupational injuries or develop occupational diseases, and after treatment, their symptoms become fixed and further treatment fails to improve the treatment outcomes, and such conditions are diagnosed as permanent disability by a designated hospital or clinic under the National Health Insurance system, they may qualify for workers' compensation disability benefits.

Since there are various types of disability benefits under the Workers' Compensation Insurance, please refer to the "Workers' Compensation - Benefits - Disability Services" section on the Labor Insurance Bureau's official website. For inquiries, call (02) 2396-1266, extension 2250, or ask your treating physician whether you meet the eligibility criteria.
