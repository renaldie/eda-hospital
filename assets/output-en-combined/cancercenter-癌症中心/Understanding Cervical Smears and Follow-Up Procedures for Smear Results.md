## Seven. Explanation of Colposcopy

The method of colposcopy is similar to that of cervical smear testing, and the examination takes about 5–6 minutes. The doctor will use a speculum (duck-billed) to widen the vagina, apply acetic acid (or another solution) to the surface of the cervix, and then use a colposcope to magnify and examine changes in the cervical epithelial cells and blood vessels in order to detect early signs of cervical disease. If necessary, a biopsy will be taken for pathological examination.

## Eight. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Test

Cervical cancer is primarily caused by infection with certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV). The sampling method is the same as that used in smear testing, to check whether the cervical cells are infected with this virus. A positive result indicates the presence of viral infection. A small number of persistent infections may pose a potential risk of progressing to pre-cancerous lesions or cervical cancer.

## Nine. Frequently Asked Questions

※ Do women who have never had sexual intercourse or who have gone through menopause need cervical smear testing?

Yes: After HPV infection, it may take 10–20 years or even longer to progress to cervical cancer. Therefore, all women who have had sexual contact—regardless of whether they have gone through menopause—should undergo regular cervical smear testing.

## Do I need cervical smear testing after a hysterectomy?

Yes: Women who have undergone a hysterectomy due to cervical cancer or pre-cancerous lesions are at a higher risk of developing vaginal cancer, so it is recommended that they continue to undergo regular cervical smear testing.

☐ For women who have had a hysterectomy due to benign conditions, please consult your physician to determine whether cervical smear testing is necessary.

※ Do women without sexual experience need cervical smear testing?

No: Women without sexual experience have a very low risk of developing cervical cancer. Additionally, cervical smear testing may compromise the integrity of the hymen.

$ ^{※} $ Can sexual activity continue if cervical smear results are abnormal?

Yes: Sexual activity does not worsen abnormal cells or transmit the condition to a partner. Therefore, there is no need to change one's current sexual lifestyle. However, it is recommended to use condoms.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1105_917_1683_1189.jpg" alt="Image" width="34%" /></div>## I. Introduction

Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers among women in our country. Studies have shown that cervical smear screening can reduce the incidence and mortality rates of invasive cervical cancer by 60–90%.

Our hospital has established a Cervical Smear Center on the second floor of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, offering a fast-track smear service with no appointment fees and no cost to patients. This service provides women with a private, confidential examination space and a convenient, comfortable examination process, aiming to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer and promote early detection and early treatment.

## II. Screening Eligibility

Women aged 30 or older who have had sexual intercourse should undergo a cervical smear examination once a year.

## III. Service Hours of the Cervical Smear Center

Monday to Friday:  
Morning: 08:30 – 11:30  
Afternoon: 13:30 – 16:30  

Saturday:  
Morning: 08:30 – 11:30

## IV. Pre-Examination Precautions

1. Do not wash the vagina.  
2. Avoid soaking in a bath.  
3. Do not insert vaginal suppositories.  
4. Avoid sexual activity the night before the examination.  
5. Avoid the menstrual period.

## V. Examination Procedure

Cervical smear examination involves using a speculum (duck-bill device) to gently open the vagina, then using a small brush to collect shed epithelial cells from the cervix. These cells are smeared onto a slide for cytological examination.

## VI. Post-Report Handling

The cervical smear report will indicate "normal," "inflammation," "abnormal," or "indeterminate."

**Normal**  
Please undergo a cervical smear examination annually.

**Inflammation**  
If you experience discomfort in the perineal area, excessive discharge, or itching, it may be due to bacterial or fungal infection. Please return to the outpatient clinic for treatment as advised by your doctor.

**Abnormal**  
Please return to the outpatient clinic promptly for further evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and determine whether treatment is needed. Abnormal smears can be broadly categorized into:  
- Indeterminate atypical cells  
- Mild precancerous lesions  
- Severe precancerous lesions  
- Invasive cancer  

Your doctor will review your examination report and may recommend additional tests such as cervical smear, colposcopy, or human papillomavirus (HPV) testing. Please follow the doctor's recommendations for subsequent examinations.

**Indeterminate**  
Due to factors such as lack of hormones in the cervix, prior treatments, or other conditions, the collected sample may not be interpretable, resulting in a report labeled "indeterminate." Patients with an "indeterminate" result should return for a repeat examination. If the reason for indeterminacy is excessive inflammatory cells, please schedule an appointment at the outpatient clinic for a physician's evaluation. The doctor will then decide whether to repeat the smear or perform the test after treatment.

Please remember: every test carries a risk of false negatives. Even if the smear result is normal, you should seek medical attention if you experience any unusual symptoms.
