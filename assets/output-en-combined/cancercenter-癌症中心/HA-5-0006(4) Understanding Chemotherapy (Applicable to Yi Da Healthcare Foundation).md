## I. Understanding Chemotherapy

## (1) Purpose of Chemotherapy

1. Treat cancer, even curing certain types of cancer.

2. Slow down cancer cell growth.

3. Prevent cancer cell spread.

4. Alleviate symptoms caused by cancer.

5. Improve patients' quality of life.

## (2) Mechanism of Action of Chemotherapy

Normal cells go through a regular life cycle from growth to death. When cells mutate or are exposed to carcinogens and accumulate sufficient genetic changes, they may become "cancer cells." Chemotherapy uses anticancer drugs to inhibit cancer cell division or interfere with their critical physiological processes, thereby eliminating cancer cells.

## (3) Where is Chemotherapy Administered?

1. Chemotherapy is generally administered in a chemotherapy room or ward via intravenous infusion.

2. It can also be taken orally at home or using a portable injection device.## (Four) How long is the chemotherapy regimen?

The duration and frequency of chemotherapy depend primarily on the type of tumor a patient has, as well as the pharmacological effects of the chemotherapeutic drugs and the patient's previous response to such drugs. Treatment may be administered daily, weekly, or monthly, but typically there is a rest period between treatments, allowing the body time to regenerate healthy new cells and regain strength.

## (Five) How effective is chemotherapy?

Various methods are used to assess the effectiveness of chemotherapy on patients, such as physical examinations, blood tests, CT scans, X-ray examinations, bone marrow tests, and biopsies.

## Two. Common side effects of chemotherapy and their management

## (One) Common side effects of chemotherapy

1. Nausea and vomiting  
2. Decreased blood cells and platelets  
3. Oral mucositis  
4. Hair loss  
5. Gastrointestinal symptoms (constipation, diarrhea)  

<center><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_446_825_748_1088.jpg" alt="Image" width="35%" /></center>## (二) Common side effects of chemotherapy and their management

1. Nausea and vomiting

(1) Avoid aspiration; when lying down, adopt a sitting position or elevate the head.

(2) Eat small, frequent meals and chew food slowly. Avoid foods that produce gas, oily foods, or spicy foods to reduce nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort.

(3) Nausea often occurs in the morning. Before getting up, consume some dry snacks such as toast, biscuits, or cereal.

(4) Encourage high-nutrition, high-calorie foods.

(5) Encourage fluid intake to prevent dehydration.

(6) Cool beverages such as juice, sports drinks, or soups can alleviate gastric discomfort and improve appetite.

(7) When experiencing dry mouth or soreness, place ice cubes or mint tablets in the mouth.

(8) After vomiting, rinse the mouth with plain water or lemon water to eliminate oral odor and reduce discomfort.

(9) Shift attention by listening to music, watching TV, or chatting with family members to alleviate nausea.

(10) For severe nausea and vomiting, administer antiemetics as prescribed by the doctor.### 2. Decreased blood cells and platelets

(1) Decreased white blood cells: Increased risk of infection.

A. Avoid consuming raw foods; all foods should be thoroughly cooked. If raw fruits are consumed, peel them first.

B. Use separate cutting boards and knives for raw and cooked foods; do not mix them. After each use, wash them with warm water and detergent.

C. Consume high-calorie, high-protein diets (unless there are dietary restrictions due to other medical conditions).

D. Wash hands frequently, minimize visits to public places, and wear a mask when necessary to reduce infection risk.

E. Maintain the integrity of the patient's skin and mucous membranes to reduce the risk of infection; men are advised to use electric razors when shaving to avoid cuts; avoid enemas, rectal suppositories, or other rectal procedures.

F. Keep the home environment simple; do not keep potted plants or fresh flowers indoors, as stagnant water, soil, and pollen can easily breed bacteria.

G. The doctor will take appropriate measures based on blood cell reports, such as administering granulocyte-stimulating hormone by injection if necessary.

(2) Anemia: Symptoms include fatigue, weakness, cold intolerance, dizziness, etc.

A. Get adequate rest, ensuring that nighttime sleep is not disturbed; short naps during the day are acceptable.

B. Change positions slowly to avoid dizziness.

C. Consume iron-rich foods such as animal organs, beef, egg yolks, dark green vegetables, dried beans, and nuts.

D. The doctor will take appropriate measures based on blood test results, such as blood transfusion if necessary.(3) Thrombocytopenia: May lead to bleeding such as bruising, gingival bleeding, prolonged menstrual periods, and prolonged coagulation time. In severe cases, it may even result in hematuria, bloody stools, or black stools.

A. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush to reduce damage to the gums and prevent bleeding.  
B. After defecation, take a warm sitz bath and gently wipe the perianal area.  
C. Avoid collisions and wear loose-fitting clothing.  
D. Do not take medications arbitrarily, especially aspirin and other pain relievers. Always consult a doctor before taking any medication.  
E. Gently blow your nose and avoid picking your nose. If nasal mucosa becomes dry and uncomfortable due to weather changes, apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly to keep it moist, or wear a mask to maintain moisture.  
F. Avoid any trauma to prevent bleeding that is difficult to stop.  
G. Seek medical attention immediately if there is abnormal bleeding.  
H. The doctor will manage the condition based on blood test results, and may administer platelet transfusion if necessary.

## (4) Oral mucositis

A. Develop the habit of brushing teeth after every meal. If oral ulcers occur, use a non-irritating toothpaste. Use a soft gauze ring around your finger or a cotton swab instead of a toothbrush to gently clean the mouth.  
B. Avoid wearing dentures.  
C. Avoid using irritating or alcohol-containing mouthwashes. It is recommended to rinse with normal saline every 2–4 hours. If oral ulcers are present, rinse every 1–2 hours.D. Drink plenty of water, carry a water bottle with you. If no disease limits it, consume at least 2500 ml of water daily, and maintain a balanced diet, especially supplementing with protein and vitamin C.

E. Avoid dry or coarse foods. When eating, mix food with soup to soften it. If oral ulcers are already present, eat small meals frequently and consume liquid foods. Also avoid acidic and irritating foods such as fried foods, spicy foods, smoking, or drinking alcohol.

F. Apply lip balm to keep lips moist and prevent cracking.

G. If experiencing dry mouth, drink beverages that stimulate saliva production, such as plum juice or lemon juice. Chewing sugar-free chewing gum (avoid if oral ulcers are present) or using saliva-stimulating toothpaste when brushing teeth may also help.

H. When oral ulcers cause pain, the following methods can help relieve discomfort:

$^{*}$ Hold ice cubes to reduce pain.

$^{*}$ Consume cold beverages such as milkshakes, ice cream, or ice pops, which can both relieve pain and provide calories.

$^{*}$ If necessary, use oral pain relief sprays or ask a doctor to prescribe a local anesthetic formulated into a mouthwash. Alternatively, consult a doctor for a topical ointment (Kenalog in orabase) to help alleviate pain.(5) Hair loss

A. Use a mild, non-irritating shampoo.  
B. Avoid chemical hair treatments, as well as excessive washing and blow-drying.  
C. Use a soft-bristled comb and avoid using hair rollers for styling.  
D. People with long hair can trim their hair to make it appear fuller and easier to manage.  
E. Use scarves, hats, or wigs to decorate and keep warm.

## (6) Gastrointestinal symptoms

A. Diarrhea  

(A) Pay attention to fluid and electrolyte replenishment. When experiencing diarrhea, you may appropriately consume sports drinks. In severe cases, intravenous infusion as prescribed by a doctor should be used for supplementation.  
(B) Eat small, frequent meals and choose low-fiber foods to avoid increasing intestinal motility and causing cramps, such as toast, white rice, noodles, fish, and skinless chicken. Avoid oily, spicy, and fried foods. If diarrhea is severe, switch to clear liquid diets, such as rice porridge or sports drinks.  
(C) Avoid foods that produce gas, such as leeks, legumes, dairy products, and dairy-based foods.  
(D) Diarrhea may lead to potassium loss; consume potassium-rich foods as needed, such as bananas, tangerines, oranges, and potatoes.  
(E) Observe the color, consistency, volume, and frequency of bowel movements. If the frequency is too high, it may cause discomfort at the anal opening. Therefore, after each bowel movement, clean with warm water and gently wipe.  
(F) If diarrhea does not improve, seek medical attention.### B. Constipation

(A) Drink at least 2,500 ml of water daily (including soup, juice, etc.) and consume fruits and vegetables.

(B) Consuming plum juice, red date juice, or plum juice can help promote bowel movements.

(C) Eat high-fiber foods such as whole grain bread, mixed grains, citrus fruits, bananas, pomelos, vegetable juice (unfiltered), and sweet potatoes.

(D) Warm sitz baths can be used; if necessary, consult a doctor to take soft laxatives or undergo enema treatment.

(E) Abdominal massage can enhance intestinal peristalsis. The steps are as follows:

Use your palm to perform circular massage in a clockwise direction on the abdomen to increase intestinal motility. Each session should last about 15–20 minutes. Perform this at the same time every day, ideally 30 minutes after breakfast (as shown in Figure 1).

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_173_655_724_1107.jpg" alt="Image" width="65%" />
</div>

Abdominal massage (Figure 1)(Three) If any of the following conditions occur, seek medical attention promptly:

1. Persistent bleeding or extensive bruising.

2. Appearance of red spots or other allergic reactions on the skin.

3. Fever (ear temperature exceeding 38.5°C), chills, or shivering; do not take fever-reducing medication arbitrarily. If needed, consult a doctor.

4. Ulceration or swelling at the injection site.

5. Any unusual pain.

6. Rapid breathing.

7. Severe diarrhea or constipation.

8. Hematuria or bloody stools.

</div>## Two. Introduction and Overview of the Implantable Injection Port (Port-A)

## 1. What is the Implantable Injection Port (Port-A):

Port-A (venous access implantable port, Port-A) is commonly known as an artificial vein. It is a synthetic silicone device composed of two parts: a spherical body and a catheter. It features an injection port and a catheter with a locking mechanism (Figure 1). The catheter is approximately 70 cm long (about 15–20 cm when implanted inside the body), and it runs from the subclavian vein through the superior vena cava to the upper part of the right atrium. The injection site is implanted into the subcutaneous tissue of the chest wall beneath the clavicle, thus not interfering with normal daily activities. It appears as a small bump, roughly the size of a 10-yuan coin (Figure 2).

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_15_615_388_867.jpg" alt="Image" width="44%" /></div>

<div style="text-align: center;">(Figure 2)</div>

## 2. How to Install the Implantable Injection Port (Port-A):

Generally, patients can be scheduled for inpatient or outpatient procedures under local or general anesthesia performed by a surgeon. A small incision of about 4–5 cm is made below the clavicle, through which the catheter is inserted into the central vein from a peripheral vein, and then the injection port is implanted beneath the skin.## Three: Why should a port-A device be implanted and what are its benefits?

Patients receiving long-term chemotherapy may experience vein thrombosis or hardening of the veins and skin, which increases the difficulty of injections and causes physical and psychological discomfort. If chemotherapy drugs leak accidentally, it may lead to local vascular and tissue necrosis.

The port-A device is specifically designed for patients requiring long-term and repeated drug administration. It eliminates the pain of repeated intravenous needle insertions, making it both safe and convenient. It can be used not only for drug injections or continuous infusion, but also for blood draws and laboratory testing. Additionally, blood products, nutrition, or other liquids can be administered through this device.

## Four: Daily self-care for the port-A device:

1. After surgery, a cosmetic adhesive will be applied to the wound and covered with sterile gauze. The cosmetic adhesive does not need to be changed—just let it naturally fall off. However, daily checks should be performed to monitor for signs of redness, swelling, heat, pain, or excessive discharge or bleeding, which may indicate infection. If any of these symptoms occur, the patient should immediately return to see a doctor for evaluation.

2. The doctor will schedule a follow-up appointment on the day of surgery. During the recovery period, bathing should be done using a wiping method. Only after the doctor evaluates and confirms wound healing can a shower be resumed.3. Activities are not restricted, but should avoid overly intense physical activities. For the arm on the same side as the artificial vascular graft, avoid full 360-degree rotation, lifting heavy objects, or direct impacts to prevent displacement of the graft.

4. If the artificial vascular graft is not in use, it is necessary to return for regular follow-up visits every 1 to 2 months or as advised by the doctor; after approval, visit the injection room to flush the catheter once with normal saline containing anticoagulant (heparin) to prevent catheter blockage.

5. Please pay attention to the blood return each time through the artificial vascular graft, as this provides important information for physicians or nurses to assess the function of the graft in the next visit.

To help medical and nursing staff better understand the changes in your pain, so that your pain can be better managed, please use the "Pain Assessment Record" in this handbook to carefully document your daily pain levels, serving as a reference for medical and nursing staff.

The "Pain Assessment Record" is filled out in two steps:

Step 1: Pain Location

Refer to the pain location diagram (Figure 1) to mark the location of your pain.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_49_582_374_1119.jpg" alt="Image" width="38%" /></div>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_394_579_776_1123.jpg" alt="Image" width="45%" /></div>Step 2: Pain Score, Frequency, and Occurrence of Side Effects.

Record the intensity of pain (Figure 2), medication usage, and whether any side effects occurred (Table 1).

<div style="text-align: center;">Figure 2: Pain Scale</div>

| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| No pain | Slight pain | Uncomfortable | Disturbing | Severe | Severe | Intense pain |  |  |  |  |

## I. What is Chemotherapy Drug Extravasation

It refers to the leakage of chemotherapy drugs from the intravenous injection site or intravenous catheter into the surrounding subcutaneous tissues, leading to tissue infiltration, blister formation, and local muscle tissue necrosis.

## II. Signs of Chemotherapy Drug Extravasation

Please immediately inform the medical or nursing staff if any of the following signs occur:

1. Pain, prickling sensation, or burning sensation at the injection site.

2. Redness or erythema at the injection site.

3. Leakage, swelling, or hard nodules at the injection site.

4. Absence of blood return or reduced flow rate in the infusion line.

## III. Skin Manifestations of Chemotherapy Extravasation

The skin manifestations of extravasation range from redness, heat, pain, and blisters to further skin ulceration and necrosis, potentially resulting in complications such as nerve damage, tissue contracture, and joint stiffness involving nerves and tendons.

Normal appearance of intravenous injection siteIV. Management of Extravasation (Must be carried out as prescribed by a physician)

1. Administer analgesics as prescribed by the physician.

2. Elevate the affected limb. Apply cold or warm compresses as instructed by medical personnel (depending on the type of medication), for 20 minutes each time, four times daily, for one to two days.

## V. Preventive Measures for Extravasation

1. Carefully select the injection site and confirm that the intravenous site or peripheral catheter has good blood return before administering chemotherapeutic drugs.

2. When administering chemotherapeutic drugs via peripheral veins, choose large vessels in the forearm, avoiding the dorsal hand, wrist inner side, wrist joint, and anterior elbow fossa.

3. For patients requiring multiple courses of chemotherapy, it is recommended to implant a peripheral venous access device (must be evaluated by a physician).

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_630_389_840_696.jpg" alt="Image" width="24%" /></div>

4. Enhance patient education regarding extravasation, including symptoms and warning signs. Patient involvement in the prevention of extravasation enables early detection and reduces the incidence of extravasation.

5. During chemotherapy treatment, if movement is required, patients should move within the hospital room and avoid going outside. Avoid any pulling or tugging actions.
