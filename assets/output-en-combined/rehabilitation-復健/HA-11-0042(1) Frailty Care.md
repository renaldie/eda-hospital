# Frailty Care

## One. Definition of Frailty

A clinical phenotype characterized by physical function decline, considered a precursor to disability, and prone to various complications such as reduced ability to perform daily activities, falls, sarcopenia, cognitive impairment, and depression, thereby lowering quality of life and increasing risks of rehospitalization or institutionalization. Early detection and timely intervention—through dietary adjustments, physical activity, and lifestyle modifications—can still offer opportunities for functional recovery, preventing and delaying disability.

## Two. Applicable Population

Individuals who have undergone professional assessment and meet the criteria for frailty.

## Three. Manifestations of Frailty

| Walking speed reduction | Decreased muscle strength, decreased grip strength |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Unintentional weight loss | Poor appetite |
| Frequent falls | Self-perceived fatigue and lack of energy |
| Reduced activity level, requiring assistance with daily living activities | Cognitive decline |

## Four. Frailty Screening Tools:

Frailty Screening (Study of Osteoporotic Fractures, SOF): If one criterion is met, it indicates pre-frailty; if two or more criteria are met, it defines frailty. Screening indicators are as follows:

| Criterion | Indicator |
|---------|-----------|
| 1. Weight loss | Has body weight decreased by 3 kg or 5% or more over the past year without intentional weight reduction? |
| 2. Decreased muscle strength | Unable to stand up from a chair five times without using hand support? |
| 3. Reduced energy | Feeling fatigued and lacking motivation to perform daily tasks for three or more days in the past week? |

## ★ When frailty issues are present

Individuals may seek further evaluation at the "Comprehensive Geriatric Clinic" or "Rehabilitation Department" at Yida Medical Clinic.## E-DA HEALTHCARE GROUP

## Five. Precautions for Care of Frailty

## (1) Enhance Nutritional Intake

It is recommended to adopt a balanced diet to ensure adequate caloric intake. For elderly individuals who need to manage their weight, avoid excessively restricting calories, as this may lead to malnutrition and increase the risk of frailty. Consume high-quality protein at a rate of 1.0–1.2 grams per kilogram of body weight daily to prevent muscle loss. Examples include milk, yogurt, eggs, chicken, and fish. Vegetarians can obtain protein from soy milk, tofu, soybean products, and other soy-based foods.

## (2) Regular Physical Exercise

Daily moderate physical activity helps frail individuals improve muscle strength and bone density, stabilize gait, and reduce the risk of falls. Recommended exercises include muscle endurance training, resistance exercises, and stretching. It is advised to perform 30–60 minutes of exercise three times per week. Examples include using resistance bands or dumbbells for resistance training, hiking, and tai chi.

## (3) Lifestyle Modifications

Regular health check-ups and vaccinations are essential. Schedule regular follow-up visits and strengthen the management of existing chronic conditions to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Spend more time outdoors during the day for sun exposure, participate in social activities and community programs (such as community care and support centers, C-level neighborhood long-term care stations), develop leisure hobbies, and maintain a positive mood.
