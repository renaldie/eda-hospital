Or hospitalization may be required to undergo treatment and survive the crisis period.

If I want to commit suicide, how can I save myself?

All unpleasant experiences that have happened to me are equally unpleasant to everyone else.

※ I have no reason to bear the weight of the world alone.

※ As soon as I express the pain and fear in my heart, it will feel like a burden has been lifted, and I will feel relieved.

$ ^{*} $ If needed, I can seek help from my family and friends.

※ Call a psychological counseling agency or a teacher, pastor, or master whom you trust, to take a break.

## Recognizing Suicide Warning Signs and Their Handling Principles

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1235_339_1607_824.jpg" alt="Image" width="22%" /></div>Suicide is a major global public health issue, and Taiwan is no exception. In recent years, the general public has developed basic awareness regarding community suicide prevention and mental health. Clinically, suicide is a complex and multifactorial issue. Risk factors among individuals who attempt suicide include demographic, psychiatric, familial, social, and even cultural factors, making suicide risk and related prevention highly complicated. This implies the need for a tool (a screening scale) to objectively and rigorously assist healthcare professionals in assessing suicide risk. Disease is undoubtedly a key factor in suicide. Among individuals who die by suicide, 70–90% have mental disorders, with depression being the most common, followed by substance use disorders and schizophrenia. Among all individuals with depression, 15% ultimately die by suicide. Chronic physical illnesses such as cancer, asthma, heart disease, end-stage renal disease, and chronic intractable pain also increase the risk of depression and suicide, and thus require greater attention. Regarding suicide attempts, women are 2–3 times more likely than men. However, when it comes to suicide success rates, men are twice as likely as women. Suicide can be categorized into three age groups: the highest rate is among the elderly, particularly those over 70 years old; next is the middle-aged and young adults aged 35–50; and finally, adolescents aged 18–25. Suicide prevention requires the participation of all members of society. The "Ask, Respond, Referral" approach means that when you notice someone expressing thoughts of suicide or depression, you should show concern, respond to their feelings, and help refer them to professional medical personnel.

## How to Identify Warning Signs of Suicide:

Generally, before carrying out a suicide attempt, individuals who are considering suicide will exhibit very clear warning signs—whether in verbal or non-verbal expressions—such as:

※ Increased mood swings, appearing emotionally low or grieving, or experiencing persistent sadness.

$ ^{*} $ Feeling "useless" or experiencing intense disappointment.

$ ^{*} $ Withdrawing from friends, family, and daily activities.

$ ^{*} $ Changes in eating, sleeping, or sexual habits.

$ ^{*} $ Making specific suicide threats.

$ ^{※} $ Mentioning expected death in letters, articles, or online messages.

$ ^{*} $ Declining academic or work performance.

※ In young friends, increased aggression, hostility, or rebellious behavior may be observed, including frequent unannounced absences.

$ ^{*} $ Increased use of drugs and alcohol.

$ ^{*} $ Unusually neglecting personal appearance.

$ ^{*} $ Sudden personality changes.

$ ^{*} $ Growing emotional distance in relationships.

$ ^{*} $ Emotional crises, such as breakups or divorces...

※ Complaints of physical symptoms, such as headaches or fatigue.

$ ^{*} $ Statements such as "This is pointless" or "There are no longer any ties."

$ ^{※} $ Suddenly gifting possessions to others, discarding items, or unexpectedly organizing previously disordered things.

Do not doubt that they are part of a high-risk suicide group. They urgently need your help. In urgent cases, seek immediate medical assistance—whether by taking them to the hospital yourself or calling 110 or 119 for emergency help. Your immediate intervention can save a fragile and helpless life!

## How to Help a Friend with Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors?

1. Create a safe and warm environment, removing potentially dangerous items from the surroundings (such as knives, belts, lighters), and securely storing them—especially during times when family members may be less vigilant, such as early mornings or late nights.

2. Build a relationship: express willingness to discuss emotional issues or other topics, offer care and affection, listen patiently to the person’s pain, and help them feel that someone cares about them, understands them, and is willing to support them. Avoid dismissing or mocking what they say, and refrain from arguing with them.

3. Listen: individuals considering suicide most need someone to listen to their inner thoughts and feelings. This listening itself is a form of support. Encourage the person to express their emotions, allow appropriate expressions of anger, and let them know that you can accept their feelings. Do not treat death as a joke; do not trivialize the person’s wishes or emotions, or make dismissive comments.

4. If the situation is severe, encourage the person to seek medical treatment: when there is an immediate risk, do not abandon them. You may seek support from any available resource (such as those listed below) or from a trusted person, or call 110 for emergency assistance.
