Do you know what alternative treatment is?  

# Heart## Do you know about alternative treatments?

## One: What is alternative treatment?

Alternative treatment is a method of drug addiction therapy. After evaluation by a physician, oral methadone or buprenorphine is used to reduce the physical and mental harm caused by injecting drugs and to lower the risk of contracting HIV or hepatitis B or C through shared needle injection.

## Two: What medications are used in alternative treatment?

Currently, two medications have been approved by the Ministry of Health and Welfare for use in alternative treatment: oral methadone and sublingual buprenorphine tablets.

## Three: What is methadone?

Oral methadone solution is a second-class controlled substance with effects similar to heroin and is used to treat heroin addiction. Its effect lasts longer than heroin, requiring only one dose per day, though it must be taken daily at a hospital.

## Four: What is buprenorphine?

Sublingual buprenorphine tablets are also a class of opioid anesthetic controlled substances and are used to treat heroin addiction. Due to its longer duration of action, after physician evaluation and based on individual conditions, the dosage can be extended to every 2–3 days. As this drug is a third-class controlled substance, patients may carry a limited amount of medication home, and after stabilization of treatment, up to two weeks' worth of prescription medication may be carried.

## Five: What are the benefits of participating in alternative treatment?

1. Reduces injection drug use, thereby decreasing the risk of contracting blood-borne diseases such as HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C.

2. Reduces discomfort caused by withdrawal symptoms from drugs.

3. Decreases the use and expenditure of heroin.

4. Eliminates the need to constantly seek drugs, thus avoiding a life of crime.

5. Improves your physical and mental health.

6. Enhances relationships and interactions with family and friends.

7. Allows you to maintain normal work, daily routines, and social activities.

## Six: What precautions should be taken when taking methadone?

1. Suddenly stopping methadone can lead to withdrawal symptoms such as trembling, cold sweats, excessive tearing, runny nose, restlessness, etc. Therefore, if discontinuation is desired, it must be discussed with a physician and gradual tapering should be followed.

2. If symptoms such as slurred speech, unsteady walking, drowsiness, confusion, pinpoint pupils, breathing difficulties, or unconsciousness occur, seek medical help immediately.

3. During methadone treatment, avoid using heroin, alcohol, amphetamines, or other sedatives and sleeping pills simultaneously, as this may lead to drug overdose and life-threatening complications. If any of these substances are used, at least a six-hour waiting period must pass before taking methadone.

## Seven: What precautions should be taken when taking buprenorphine?

1. Using buprenorphine immediately after using heroin or methadone may lead to acute withdrawal symptoms. It should only be taken after a gap of at least 12–24 hours following heroin use or at least 24 hours after methadone use, and only if withdrawal symptoms have appeared.

2. Do not chew or swallow; it must dissolve under the tongue to ensure proper effectiveness.

3. Not recommended for pregnant women.

4. Must not be administered intravenously, as this may trigger acute withdrawal symptoms.

5. Overdose symptoms may include slowed breathing, muscle spasms, weakness, unconsciousness, confusion, and pinpoint pupils. If any of these symptoms occur, seek medical help immediately.

6. Avoid using alcohol, amphetamines, or other sedatives and sleeping pills simultaneously, as this may lead to drug interactions and poisoning.

## Eight: How to manage co-existing physical or psychological conditions?

1. For blood-borne diseases such as hepatitis B or C and HIV: refer patients to relevant departments and provide free anonymous HIV screening services.

2. For insomnia, emotional distress, or other substance abuse addictions: refer patients to outpatient mental health or psychosomatic clinics for further counseling support.

3. For other physical conditions: refer patients to relevant departments.
