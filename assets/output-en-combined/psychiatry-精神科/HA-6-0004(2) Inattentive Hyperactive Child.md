If you are concerned that your child may fall behind in learning.

$ ^{*} $ If you are worried that he might be misunderstood by classmates.

If these behaviors affect your parent-child relationship.

If they lead to marital conflict in parenting.

If communication between parents and teachers is difficult.

You may consider discussing this with a pediatric psychiatry or child psychology specialist!

Simply helping your child allows the neurotransmitters in their brain cells to maintain prolonged activity, enabling them to better resist distractions, exercise self-control, and follow instructions.

Of course, your encouragement, patience, and care are indispensable!
