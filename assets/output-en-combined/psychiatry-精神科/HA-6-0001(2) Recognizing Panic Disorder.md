## Understanding Panic Disorder

## Understanding Panic Attacks and Panic Disorder

## 1. Panic:

Refers to an acute and intense state of anxiety accompanied by widespread unease and multiple symptoms. There are two diagnostic forms: panic attack and panic disorder. Prior to a panic episode, there may be triggering factors or warning signs, but there may also be no identifiable cause. In fact, panic attacks without clear triggers are quite common. Currently, panic is believed to result from the brain sending incorrect alarm signals, causing the body to produce corresponding alarm symptoms. Although these symptoms are extremely uncomfortable, they generally do not lead to serious or life-threatening issues. Patients often visit the emergency department due to the physical discomfort of panic attacks, but symptoms usually resolve on their own shortly after.

## 2. Panic Attack:

Refers to a sudden surge of intense fear or dread accompanied by at least four of the following symptoms (as defined by DSM-5), reaching peak intensity within minutes, and lasting from several minutes to several hours:

| No. | Symptoms |
|-----|---------|
| 1 | Palpitations, rapid heartbeat, or accelerated heart rate |
| 2 | Sweating |
| 3 | Trembling or shaking |
| 4 | Feeling of shortness of breath |
| 5 | Feeling of choking or suffocation |
| 6 | Chest or abdominal pain |
| 7 | Nausea or abdominal discomfort |
| 8 | Dizziness, lightheadedness, unsteadiness, or feeling like fainting |
| 9 | Chills or feeling of fever |
| 10 | Sensory abnormalities such as numbness or tingling |
| 11 | Dissociative feelings, such as feeling that surroundings are unreal or losing sense of self (feeling mentally or physically detached) |
| 12 | Fear of losing control or going crazy |
| 13 | Fear of imminent death |

## 3. Panic Disorder:

If a person experiences recurrent, unexpected panic attacks and continues to worry for over a month about the possibility of future attacks and their consequences (such as fearing loss of control or heart attack), or if they alter their behavior due to fear of panic attacks (e.g., avoiding going out, driving, or flying), this is diagnosed as "panic disorder." Patients often mistakenly believe their symptoms are due to physical illness and seek medical help repeatedly. However, if a proper diagnosis rules out physical illness or other substance-related factors, and if combined with medication and psychological therapy, symptoms and quality of life can be significantly improved.

## 4. Panic Disorder:

1. Medication treatment: Antianxiety medications and sedatives with different mechanisms of action can regulate neurotransmitters in the brain, stabilizing the autonomic nervous system and lowering the overall threshold for anxiety.

2. Psychological treatment: Having an accurate understanding of panic disorder is crucial. Patients should be reassured that panic attacks do not pose a life-threatening risk. Combining relaxation techniques with cognitive behavioral therapy can further enhance treatment effectiveness.

## 5. Other Notes:

| No. | Recommendations |
|-----|----------------|
| 1 | Maintain a regular daily routine, including consistent sleep and wake times |
| 2 | Develop a regular exercise habit; any type of physical activity is beneficial |
| 3 | Avoid overwork or prolonged exposure to significant stress |
| 4 | Limit stimulant beverages; reduce alcohol intake (ideally avoid) and coffee (no more than one cup per day) |
| 5 | Do not abruptly stop medication when symptoms are stable; consult with a doctor to adjust medication and treatment plan to avoid relapse |
