## Post-Operative Care for Hernia Surgery  

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_663_328_1122_829.jpg" alt="Image" width="38%" /></div>## Postoperative Care for Hernia

## 1. What is a Hernia?

Definition: Commonly known as "protrusion" or "dropped intestine," a hernia occurs when a portion of abdominal organs (most commonly the small intestine, ovary, peritoneum, or part of the large intestine) protrudes through a weak area in the abdominal wall.

In the early stages, a hernia may cause pain or discomfort. The area may swell, especially when standing or straining, and the swelling usually subsides or reduces when lying down.

If a hernia patient experiences abdominal cramps, vomiting, abdominal distension, or if a hernia that was previously reducible no longer reduces, this indicates that the intestine or abdominal contents have become trapped (a strangulated hernia). This can lead to tissue necrosis and requires prompt treatment.

## 2. Surgery is the most effective treatment.

## 3. Postoperative Care:

1. After surgery, once the anesthesia has worn off and if there is no nausea or vomiting, start eating with small sips of water and gradually progress to solid food.

2. Keep the wound clean and dry until stitches are removed.

3. Avoid soaking in a bath before stitches are removed; instead, take a shower and be careful not to wet the dressing.

4. Two to three days after surgery, mild swelling in the scrotum or wound area is normal. Apply ice packs while lying down and elevate the scrotum to promote venous return. This should resolve within a short period.

5. Minimize activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure, such as coughing or a child crying.

6. When moving or coughing, press gently on the wound to reduce pain.

7. Eat more high-fiber vegetables, fruits, and fluids regularly to develop a consistent bowel habit and prevent constipation.

8. Avoid lifting heavy objects for three months.

9. Patients with abdominal hernias should wear a supportive abdominal belt to support the abdomen for at least three months.

10. Return to the hospital if any of the following occur:

(1) Persistent high fever  
(2) Persistent vomiting  
(3) Wound redness or increased discharge
