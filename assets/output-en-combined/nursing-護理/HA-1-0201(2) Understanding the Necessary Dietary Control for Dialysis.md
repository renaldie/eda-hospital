## Understanding Dietary Control in Dialysis

## 1. Calories:

During dialysis, glucose in the dialysate is used to remove excess body fluids.  
Excess calories may lead to weight gain. To maintain an ideal body weight, you must reduce calorie intake from food, especially from refined sugar-containing foods such as:  
carbonated drinks, fruit juices, cakes, egg tarts, and pineapple buns.  
Starchy foods like rice, noodles, sweet potatoes, and taro should also be consumed in moderation.  
Fruits, which contain natural sugars, should be eaten in appropriate amounts.  
Patients with diabetes should discuss portion sizes with a dietitian to avoid unstable blood glucose levels that may affect dialysis outcomes.

## 2. Protein:

During peritoneal dialysis, protein loss occurs. Therefore, it is essential to consume high biological value protein sources such as eggs, fish, chicken, duck, pork, and tofu.  
When peritonitis occurs, protein loss increases significantly, and higher protein intake is required.

## 3. Potassium:

Patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis rarely experience hyperkalemia, so dietary intake of vegetables and fruits is generally more flexible.  
If blood potassium levels are elevated, the following methods can be used to reduce potassium intake:  
(1) Avoid raw vegetables; instead, blanch them in boiling water before stir-frying.  
(2) Avoid foods with high potassium content, such as coffee, strong tea, concentrated meat broth, MSG, dried vegetables and fruits, traditional Chinese herbal tonics, low-sodium salt, and salt-free soy sauce.

## 4. Phosphorus:

Elevated blood phosphorus levels can lead to bone disease and skin itching. Therefore, calcium supplements (phosphate binders) should be taken with every meal or snack to effectively reduce blood phosphorus levels. Phosphorus is widely present in various foods.## EOH Jewish Dietitian Nutritionist Group E-DA HEALTHCARE GROUP

Among various foods, dairy products, organs, nuts, carbonated drinks, cola, whole grains, and yeast contain higher levels.

## Five: Water and Salt:

When blood pressure is high or edema is present, sodium (salt) intake should be appropriately limited. Foods high in sodium (salt), such as pickled and smoked products, canned foods, processed foods, tomato sauce, soy sauce, etc., can be enhanced with natural seasonings to improve flavor, such as garlic, onions, perilla, cilantro, lemon, chili, and star anise.

## Six: Vitamins and Minerals:

Patients undergoing dialysis are prone to deficiencies in vitamin B complex, vitamin C, and folic acid; fat-soluble vitamins do not require additional supplementation. Please take vitamins and minerals as prescribed by your doctor.
