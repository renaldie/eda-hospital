(Three) Daily Health Care: In terms of daily health care, the most important aspect is avoiding worries and maintaining a regular sleep routine. In addition, special attention should be paid to the following treatment principles:

1. For individuals with hypertension, diabetes, or elevated lipid levels, early intervention should be undertaken to prevent the occurrence of complications.

2. Maintain a healthy body weight to avoid excessive obesity.

3. Engage in moderate and regular physical activity—between 75 and 150 minutes per week. The ideal heart rate during exercise should be approximately 50% to 80% of (220 minus age). According to surveys, individuals who engage in moderate physical activity rarely experience heart disease episodes.

4. Smoking should be strictly avoided, as nicotine in tobacco causes blood vessel constriction and may lead to angina.

5. For those who have never consumed alcohol, continue to maintain zero alcohol intake. If you have a light drinking habit, limit alcohol consumption to no more than 14 grams per day (for example, a 330cc bottle of Taiwan beer with 4.5% alcohol content contains approximately 330 × 0.045 = 14.85 grams of alcohol).

6. Maintain a calm mood and try to minimize emotional excitement and stress.

## Angina Pectoris

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1156_328_1661_657.jpg" alt="Image" width="30%" /></div>## One. What is angina pectoris?

Angina pectoris, also known as stable coronary artery disease, refers to chest pain caused by myocardial ischemia, typically resulting from coronary artery atherosclerosis or spasm. The severity of angina symptoms varies according to the degree of myocardial hypoxia. Angina is classified into three types: unstable, stable, and variant angina, based on the severity of the disease.

· Discomfort in the neck, jaw, teeth, or back; episodes last for several minutes and require rest or medication to relieve.

## Three. Causes

The underlying cause is insufficient myocardial perfusion, resulting in reduced blood supply to the myocardium. This may be due to thrombosis within blood vessels, vascular spasm, or increased oxygen demand—such as during exercise or tachycardia. Insufficient myocardial perfusion primarily results from coronary artery disease. Other types of heart disease or uncontrolled hypertension can also lead to angina.

## Four. Risk Factors

Non-invasive methods: electrocardiogram (ECG), blood tests, echocardiography, exercise stress test, nuclear medicine, CT scan.  
Invasive methods: coronary angiography.

Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers.

Invasive medical treatments: percutaneous coronary angioplasty, stent placement.

Avoid high-intensity physical activities that increase arterial workload, such as competitive sports like basketball or football. Patients with angina can engage in games similar to bowling or croquet, or participate in light golf activities. The best physical activities for daily life include walking, climbing stairs, practicing tai chi, or gentle yoga.

(2) Dietary aspects: To prevent worsening of coronary arteries, it is best to modify the patient's dietary habits. Patients with angina should avoid animal fats such as lard, pork fat, or smoked meats. These foods accelerate atherosclerosis and must be strictly avoided.
