# Precautions for Removal of Internal and External Fixation Devices

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_590_457_1120_914.jpg" alt="Image" width="47%" /></div>## One: Understanding Orthopedic Internal and External Fixation Devices

Fractures of the limbs can be classified into internal fixation and external fixation based on their treatment objectives and indications.

1. External fixation devices are primarily used for complex open fractures, pelvic fractures, joint deformity correction, or limb lengthening procedures. They work by directly pressing on the fracture site to accelerate bone healing. After the fracture is realigned during surgery, the fixation device is inserted to maintain the injured bone in its normal position, providing stable support and promoting healing.

2. Internal fixation devices are instruments designed to stabilize the bone. Once the bone has gained sufficient time to heal and regained the ability to withstand forces, the internal fixation can be removed.

## Two: Wound Care Methods

1. First, use a sterile cotton swab dipped in normal saline to wipe away secretions from the wound, wiping from the center of the wound outward. Do not wipe back and forth. After cleaning thoroughly, apply a water-soluble iodine solution, then cover the wound with a sterile gauze and secure it with paper tape.

2. After surgery, keep the wound dry and avoid contact with water. If the dressing becomes wet, change the dressing immediately.

## Three: Precautions

1. After surgery, the wound will be wrapped with elastic bandages for stabilization. Upon returning home, if you feel the bandage is too tight or notice whitening or numbness at the extremity, loosen the elastic bandage for 10–15 minutes. Then, re-wrap the elastic bandage from the extremity toward the body, ensuring that the tightness allows two fingers to fit comfortably between the edge of the bandage.

2. After removal of internal or external fixation devices from hands or feet, swelling at the extremities is common. Elevate the affected limb to promote venous return and prevent swelling.

3. After surgery, there may be some oozing from the wound, which appears as a circular area on the gauze the size of a 5- to 10-cent coin. If oozing persists, apply pressure for 5–10 minutes and elevate the limb above heart level. If the condition does not improve or if the wound shows signs of redness, swelling, heat, or pain, seek medical attention immediately.

4. Due to prolonged inactivity, muscles and joints may become stiff and atrophied. Therefore, when performing range-of-motion exercises, do not move too quickly (pre-exercise, apply heat to the joint area for 15 minutes). For hand surgery patients, using a soft tennis ball to perform grasping exercises can help improve wrist and finger joint mobility. However, wrist joint movement remains limited; patients should consult the orthopedic outpatient clinic for evaluation to determine whether rehabilitation is necessary.
