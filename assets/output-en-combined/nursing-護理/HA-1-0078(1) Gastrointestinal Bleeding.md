## I. Definition:

Gastrointestinal bleeding refers to bleeding occurring at any point from the esophagus to the anus. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding refers to bleeding above the Treitz ligament of the duodenum, while lower gastrointestinal bleeding refers to bleeding below this point.

## II. Causes:

1. Diseases: Gastric ulcers, duodenal ulcers, variceal bleeding in the esophagus, etc.

2. Other factors: Stress, painkillers, alcohol, tobacco, or certain foods.

## III. Symptoms:

## (1) Upper gastrointestinal bleeding:

1. Black or tarry stools. If the bleeding is substantial and the blood remains in the gastrointestinal tract for a short time, the stool may appear bright red.

2. Patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding may vomit fresh blood or coffee-ground material.

3. In severe cases, patients may experience dizziness, thirst, tachycardia, pallor, cold extremities, cold sweats, shortness of breath, chest discomfort, pain, or decreased urine output.

4. When blood pressure drops, some patients may faint while using the toilet, become confused, or show signs of shock; in severe cases, this may lead to death.

## (2) Lower gastrointestinal bleeding:

1. Bright red blood in the stool indicates bleeding in the lower gastrointestinal tract, such as the ileum, colon, rectum, or anus.

2. Bleeding below the Treitz ligament of the duodenum will not result in vomiting blood, because the intestines do not have the ability to reverse peristalsis, preventing blood from flowing back into the stomach and being vomited.

## IV. Home Care Precautions:

1. During the acute phase, fasting should be maintained for 24 to 48 hours. If there is no black or bloody stool, cold liquids may be introduced gradually, with small, frequent meals. Normal diet can be resumed when there is no discomfort and stools return to normal color and consistency.

2. Rest in bed for 24 to 48 hours during the acute phase.

2. During the acute phase, avoid getting up and moving around as much as possible when resting in bed.

3. Someone should accompany the patient during bowel movements or bathing.

4. When sitting down, standing up, or getting out of bed, movements should be gradual and gentle and slow. If getting up to move around, first sit down and rest briefly before standing, to avoid positional hypotension.
