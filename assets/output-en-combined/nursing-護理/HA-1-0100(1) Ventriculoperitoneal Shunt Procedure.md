## Five. Post-discharge Precautions:

1. Regular follow-up visits for check-ups.

2. The surgical wound site should be kept clean and dry, avoiding scratching to prevent infection.

3. There are generally no restrictions on daily life, but head injuries or accidental collisions should be avoided.

4. If any of the following symptoms occur—such as vomiting, diarrhea, fever, restlessness, headache, seizures, abnormal breathing, or redness, swelling, heat, or pain at the site where the shunt passes—please seek medical attention immediately.

</div>## Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt

## 1. What is hydrocephalus?

When the circulation system within the brain is obstructed—whether due to congenital or acquired causes—excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) accumulates, leading to a condition known as "hydrocephalus."

## 2. What is ventriculoperitoneal shunting?

A very flexible shunt tube is connected at one end to the ventricle of the brain and at the other end to the peritoneal cavity, allowing excess cerebrospinal fluid to safely flow into the abdominal cavity and be absorbed.

## 3. Preoperative preparations:

1. Complete the surgical consent form.

2. Shave the head and wash it clean the day before surgery.

3. Take a shower the day before surgery to keep the skin clean and dry.

4. Fast for 6–8 hours before surgery—no food, water, or medication should be consumed—to prevent vomiting during surgery, which could lead to aspiration pneumonia and pose a risk.

$ ^{*} $ Some shunt tubes are equipped with a ball-valve device, which serves the following functions:

1. Regulates and guides the flow rate of cerebrospinal fluid.

2. Monitors whether the shunt tube is patent (open and unobstructed).

3. Enables special diagnostic checks.

4. Allows the physician to withdraw cerebrospinal fluid or perform irrigation and other therapeutic procedures when necessary.

## 4. Postoperative precautions:

1. If the patient's condition is stable after surgery, the nursing staff will inform you when it is safe to start eating. Before eating, give the patient a small amount of water. If there is no vomiting, the patient may begin consuming liquids or other foods.

2. Please ensure the patient lies on the side that was not operated on or remains flat to avoid putting pressure on the surgical wound.

3. Normally, the doctor will come to change the dressing on postoperative day three. The surgical wounds—on the head, neck, and waist—must remain dry to prevent infection.

4. Encourage the patient to perform deep breathing and effective coughing to prevent pneumonia. Family members can gently tap the patient’s back and shoulder blades in a cupped hand position. Turn the patient every 1–2 hours to prevent prolonged pressure on any one area of the skin, which could cause discomfort or pressure ulcers.

5. In the first and second days after surgery, avoid sudden changes in body position to prevent excessive flow of cerebrospinal fluid.
