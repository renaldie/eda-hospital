<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_694_540_1139_1046.jpg" alt="Image" width="37%" /></div>## Subarachnoid Hemorrhage

## I. What is subarachnoid hemorrhage:

Bleeding from blood vessels located in the space between the arachnoid and pia mater, leading to damage of brain tissue.

## II. Causes:

* Head trauma  
$ ^{*} $ Cerebral aneurysm rupture  
$ ^{*} $ Intracranial aneurysm rupture  
$ ^{*} $ Cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) bleeding

## III. Symptoms:

Due to vessel rupture and obstruction of blood supply to brain tissue, the following symptoms occur:

* Visual disturbances, photophobia, diplopia  
* Vomiting, nausea  

$ ^{*} $ Dizziness  
$ ^{*} $ Sudden severe headache  
$ ^{*} $ Motor dysfunction  
* Neck stiffness  
* Drowsiness

## IV. Diagnosis and examinations:

* Clinical neurological examination  
* Computed tomography (CT) scan

$ ^{*} $ Lumbar puncture  
$ ^{*} $ Angiography  
$ ^{*} $ Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

## V. Treatment methods:

The primary goal is to prevent increased intracranial pressure and avoid worsening of the condition. Pay attention to the following measures:

* Absolute bed rest until the condition improves; the head of the bed can be elevated  
## 30 ~45 degrees  

$ ^{*} $ Maintain a quiet environment and avoid strong light exposure  
$ ^{*} } Ensure safety and raise bed rails  
$ ^{*} $ Pay attention to diet, avoid constipation. Limit coffee and tea intake, and avoid extremely cold or hot foods.  
$ ^{*} $ Avoid smoking  
* Medical staff will closely monitor vital signs such as blood pressure, pulse, and pupil response  

$ ^{*} $ Avoid rectal temperature measurement or enema treatments  
$ ^{*} $ Surgical treatment of aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)

## VI. Daily care:

$ ^{*} $ Signs of increased intracranial pressure include:

◎ Changes in consciousness, such as drowsiness or coma  
◎ Worsening of headache, nausea, vomiting, and neck stiffness  
◎ Occurrence of seizures  

◎ Immediately notify medical staff if increased intracranial pressure is observed  

$ ^{*} $ Maintain basic personal hygiene  
◎ Keep the body and skin clean  
◎ Clean and change surgical wounds postoperatively  
◎ Monitor for signs of infection such as fever, redness, swelling, heat, and pain at the wound site  

* Prevent complications from prolonged bed rest  

◎ Assist with turning every two hours to prevent pressure ulcers  
◎ Encourage deep breathing, effective coughing, and sputum clearance to prevent pneumonia  
◎ Assist with joint and muscle movement of affected limbs to prevent muscle atrophy and joint stiffness
