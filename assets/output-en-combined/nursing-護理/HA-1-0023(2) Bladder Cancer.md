## Five. Postoperative Precautions:

1. Measure urine output every hour within the first 24 hours after surgery, and then at least every 8 hours thereafter.

2. Initially, check every 4 hours for leakage from the catheter bag and for skin irritation below the catheter bag. After six checks at 4-hour intervals, switch to checking every 8 hours.

3. Inspect the catheter site every hour during the first 24 hours after surgery. If no abnormalities are found, extend the interval to every 4 hours, and then to every 8 hours.

4. Record the size, shape, and color of the catheter opening. A normal catheter opening is pink or red. If the opening becomes darker or bluish, it may indicate inadequate blood supply and the beginning of necrosis.

5. Monitor for signs of peritonitis, such as abdominal pain or fever. Leakage from the anastomotic site or separation of the ureter from the catheter can lead to urine entering the peritoneal cavity.

## Six. Prognosis:

The prognosis of bladder cancer is closely related to the stage of the disease. In general, early-stage (Stage 0 and Stage I) cancers treated with electrocautery or urethral resection have a very good prognosis, although recurrence is common—recurrence is a characteristic feature of bladder cancer. The prognosis worsens significantly in stages two and beyond, with a five-year survival rate of only about 20%. Early diagnosis is therefore crucial for determining the prognosis of bladder cancer.

## Seven. Post-Discharge Instructions:

1. Avoid foods containing preservatives and chemicals. Foods that may contain pesticides should be thoroughly washed.

2. Drink plenty of water daily, maintaining a urine volume of over 2000 cc to reduce the concentration of carcinogens in the bladder.

3. Avoid developing the habit of holding urine.

4. Take large amounts of vitamins A, C, and B6 daily to acidify urine and reduce urinary tract infections.

5. Do not smoke.

6. Minimize hair dyeing and exposure to dyes and organic solvents.

Bladder Cancer  

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1214_395_1680_977.jpg" alt="Image" width="27%" /></div>## Bladder Cancer

## I. Causes:

The bladder is located below the abdomen and above the pelvis. Its main functions are to store urine flowing from both kidneys and to expel urine. The primary structure of the bladder is muscle, and the inner surface that comes into contact with urine is covered with a layer of transitional epithelial cells that are waterproof. Bladder cancer mostly originates from pathological changes in these transitional epithelial cells. Additionally, since the entire urinary system—from the kidneys, ureters, bladder to the urethra—is lined with this type of tissue, if transitional epithelial cell cancer occurs in the bladder, there is also a possibility of the same type of cancer occurring in other parts of the urinary system.

The exact cause of bladder cancer has not yet been fully understood. It is currently known that certain industrial products, dyes, medications, smoking, urinary tract infections, cystitis, and bladder parasites are associated with the development of bladder cancer. Internal metabolic substances and genetic factors within cells also play important roles.

## II. Types of Bladder Cancer:

90% are transitional cell carcinomas, 6% are squamous cell carcinomas, and the remainder are adenocarcinomas. Among transitional cell carcinomas in the urinary system, 90% occur in the bladder, 9% in the kidney, and 1% in the ureter.

## III. Possible Symptoms:

1. Painless hematuria and blood clots in urine.

2. Difficulty in urination and ureteral obstruction.

3. Weight loss and anemia.

## IV. Staging and Treatment of Bladder Cancer:

The treatment of bladder cancer varies depending on the extent of disease invasion. Generally, bladder cancer is classified into five stages: Stage 0 to Stage IV.

Stage 0: The tumor is confined to the mucosal layer. Treatment involves transurethral resection or electrocautery.

Stage I: The tumor has invaded beyond the mucosal layer but has not reached the muscular layer. Treatment options include transurethral resection or electrocautery; laser ablation is also feasible.

Patients in Stage II require regular follow-up cystoscopic examinations, and intravesical chemotherapy is often recommended. Approximately 30% of patients do not experience recurrence, while the rest remain at risk of recurrence. About 10% of these patients may develop deeper tumor invasion. Therefore, general recommendations for cystoscopic follow-up are: once every three months for the first two years, then every six months for the next two years, and finally once a year thereafter.

Stage II: The tumor has invaded the bladder muscle layer. Following bladder removal, a urinary diversion surgery such as a skin ureterostomy is performed. If the tumor is completely removed and the cancer cells are well-differentiated, the follow-up treatment used in Stage I may be adopted. If the tumor is incompletely removed or the cancer cells are poorly differentiated, third-stage treatment methods are typically employed.

Stage III: The tumor has invaded deep into the muscular layer or has extended beyond the bladder wall. Endoscopic surgery is not sufficient to completely remove the tumor, and more extensive treatments are required. These may include radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgical intervention, or combinations of these methods. Surgical treatment primarily involves bladder removal, followed by reconstruction using a segment of colon or small intestine to replace the bladder.

Stage IV: The tumor has invaded organs outside the bladder or has metastasized to lymph nodes. At this stage, treatment primarily involves radiotherapy or chemotherapy.
