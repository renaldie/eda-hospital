# Understanding Catheter Self-Care

## I. Catheter Exit Site Care

## (1) Importance of Catheter Exit Site Care:

Peritoneal dialysis catheters can be considered the lifeline for patients with end-stage renal disease. To prevent bacterial invasion that could compromise the integrity of the catheter exit site and lead to exit site infection, proper daily care of the catheter exit site is absolutely essential.

## (2) Catheter Exit Site Care:

1. Handwashing: Before performing catheter exit site care, thoroughly wash your hands with soap and rub until bubbles form. Then rinse them with clean, running water, and dry them with a clean paper towel before touching the catheter exit site.

2. Wearing a mask: A mask must cover both the mouth and nose. Both the caregiver and the patient should wear masks during the dressing change procedure.

3. Catheter Exit Site Care Procedure:
   (1) Check for signs of redness, swelling, heat, pain, discharge, or granulation tissue at the exit site.
   (2) Wet a cotton swab with normal saline and gently wipe the exit site in a circular motion.
   (3) Wipe the area with a dry cotton swab, then lightly clean the exit site with a small cotton swab.
   (4) Cover the top of the exit site with a Y-shaped gauze pad and a small gauze pad, securing them with paper tape.
   (5) Secure the catheter to the skin with paper tape to prevent pulling on the exit site.
   (6) Check that the titanium connector is tightly secured, then cover it with a 3×3 cm gauze pad.

$ ^{*} $ Note: For newly placed catheter exit sites or those at risk of infection, follow the doctor’s advice to apply topical ointment or povidone-iodine.

2. Abnormal catheter exit site: When catheter exit sites are abnormal, failure to promptly address the issue may lead to exit site infection, which in severe cases can progress to tunnel infection. Bacteria may enter the peritoneal cavity through the infected exit site, causing peritonitis.

## 2. Preventing Catheter Exit Site Infections

1. Maintain personal and environmental hygiene, and change into clean clothes daily.

2. Take a daily shower; during showering, wear a disposable ostomy bag to prevent water contamination. After showering, promptly perform catheter exit site care to keep the area dry.

3. Avoid soaking in baths, hot tubs, warm baths, or swimming, as these easily lead to catheter exit site infections.

4. Do not shower when the catheter exit site has not fully healed after new catheter placement or if there are signs of infection. For the upper body, use a damp towel to wipe; for the lower body, rinse with clean water to avoid wetting the catheter exit site, which could lead to more severe infections.

5. If the catheter exit site becomes wet or dirty, change the dressing as soon as possible, especially during hot and humid summer months when sweating is heavy.

6. When performing catheter exit site care, do not turn on air conditioning or fans, as airborne dust may contaminate the exit site.

7. If the catheter exit site shows redness, swelling, heat, pain, discharge, or ulceration, seek immediate treatment at the peritoneal dialysis room and increase the frequency of dressing changes.

8. Do not apply non-prescribed ointments, powders, petroleum jelly, creams, or other topical medications to the catheter exit site without a doctor's prescription.

9. Secure the catheter to prevent pulling; do not tie your waistband at or near the catheter exit site. Avoid friction or scratching the exit site. If skin itching occurs, request a prescribed anti-itch cream from your doctor.

10. Use a secure dressing to fix the catheter and protect it.

## 3. Bathing

1. Use of Ostomy Bag:

## 4. Exercise

1. Before exercising, secure the catheter. Suitable activities include walking, brisk walking, hiking, cycling, qigong, dancing (such as folk dance or slow social dances), and warm-up exercises.

2. Avoid the following activities:

(1) Exercises that may pull on the peritoneal dialysis catheter, such as sit-ups, boxing, or martial arts.

(2) Activities that may cause displacement of the abdominal catheter, such as inverted positions or leg lifts.
