Sciatica is pain caused by compression, twisting, trauma, or ischemia of the sciatic nerve.

## Two. Causes:

1. Poor posture: commonly due to improper sitting or standing postures.

2. Trauma: such as compression of the sciatic nerve root caused by accidents or falls.

3. Sports-related injuries: sudden twisting of the lower back during physical activity, leading to stretching or tearing of the sciatic nerve root.

4. Herniated intervertebral disc: common among young and middle-aged individuals.

5. Degenerative spinal diseases resulting in sciatica, commonly known as "bone spurs," which are more prevalent in older populations.

## Three. Symptoms:

"Sciatica" refers to typical lower back and buttock pain with numbness and tingling that radiates from the lower back or buttocks down the back of the thigh, extending to the calf and even the foot, and usually occurs on one side only.

## Four. Diagnosis and Examination:

A physician should conduct a thorough evaluation and arrange appropriate diagnostic tests such as X-ray, nerve conduction studies, CT scan, spinal radiography, or MRI based on the condition.

## Five. Treatment Methods:

1. During the acute phase, bed rest is recommended; pain usually significantly improves after 3–5 days.

2. Depending on the condition, pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory medications, muscle relaxants, and supportive braces or lumbar supports may be prescribed as advised by a doctor.

3. Physical therapy, heat therapy, and electrical stimulation can relax muscles and reduce pain; traction can relieve pressure on the compressed nerve roots.

4. Rehabilitation exercises to strengthen the lower back muscles.

5. If there are clear neurological symptoms (such as muscle atrophy, loss of bladder or bowel control, or unbearable pain), and conservative treatments fail to show improvement after 6–8 weeks, surgical intervention may be considered.

## Six. Daily Care:

1. Avoid lifting heavy objects.

2. Avoid intense lower back movements.

3. Maintain proper sitting and standing posture.

4. Avoid wearing high-heeled shoes; wear flat-soled shoes instead.

5. Choose a mattress that is not too soft.

6. For more severe cases, a lumbar support belt may be worn as needed to enhance lower back support.
