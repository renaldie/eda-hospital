## I. Precautions:

For patients undergoing general anesthesia, food can be consumed once fully awake. Begin by sipping 1–2 mouthfuls of liquid (such as water, sugar water, milk, or juice). If no vomiting occurs, then proceed to consume semi-liquid foods like milk shakes or clear porridge.

☐ Avoid forceful coughing or blowing your nose. When sneezing, keep your mouth open to maintain pressure in the Eustachian tube.

☐ If experiencing nausea or dizziness, avoid sudden standing or turning to ensure safety.

☐ Do not allow water to enter the affected ear for seven days to prevent infection.

☐ Avoid swimming, diving, and flying for ___ months after surgery.

☐ Do not remove the gauze or cotton ball from the affected ear yourself or pull it. It should be removed by the doctor during a follow-up visit.

☐ A small amount of fresh blood may seep from the surgical site after surgery. However, if there is persistent oozing or if the entire gauze becomes soaked, apply pressure for 5–10 minutes. If the bleeding does not stop or if redness, swelling, heat, or pain appears, seek medical attention immediately.

☐ When applying ear drops, position the affected ear upward. After applying, keep the same side upward and lie still for 5–10 minutes.

☐ If using two different types of ear drops, allow at least 5 minutes between applications. For liquid suspensions, shake well before use.
