# Understanding Colon Cancer

## I. Introduction

According to statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), Taiwan ranks sixth globally and first in Asia for colon cancer incidence, with 40.5 cases per 100,000 people. Since colon cancer typically presents no obvious symptoms in its early stages, regular screening is crucial for early detection and treatment. Although the disease primarily affects middle-aged individuals, there has been a recent trend of decreasing onset age, making it essential not to be complacent.

## II. Causes

90% of cancer types are adenocarcinomas, which occur due to gene mutations. These mutations may result from a combination of environmental factors, dietary habits, and genetic inheritance.

## IV. Clinical Symptoms

Common symptoms include:

Abdominal pain

- Changes in bowel habits: gradually developing diarrhea or constipation  
- Changes in stool consistency: thin, bloody, or mucoid stools  
- Unexplained weight loss and loss of appetite  
- Abdominal mass  
- Weakness and fatigue, possibly due to iron deficiency anemia  

In addition, symptoms vary depending on the location of the tumor:

The right side of the colon (cecum, ascending colon) is more likely to present with bloating or positive fecal occult blood test results. The left side of the colon (descending colon, sigmoid colon, rectum) typically manifests with abdominal pain, bloody stools, or changes in bowel habits.

## III. Risk Factors

## • Genetic Factors

Individuals with first-degree relatives (such as parents or siblings) who have a history of colon cancer face a 2- to 3-fold increased risk. If two first-degree relatives have been diagnosed with colon cancer, or if one first-degree relative developed the disease before age 50, the risk can rise up to 3 times.

## Lifestyle Factors

1. Smoking and alcohol consumption  
2. Obesity and lack of physical activity  
3. High intake of red meat, processed meats, and refined sugars  

• Age factor

Most patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer are over 50 years old. However, in recent years, the onset age has been gradually decreasing, with an increasing number of cases being diagnosed in individuals under 40.

## Related Medical History

1. Adenomatous polyps: Adenomatous polyps are benign in nature, but if they continue to grow, they may become malignant. Adenomas larger than 1 cm have significantly increased risks of malignant transformation.

2. Inflammatory bowel diseases: Conditions such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease increase the risk of colorectal cancer by 4 to 20 times, especially with long-standing disease duration.

## V. Diagnostic Tests

- Digital rectal examination: Approximately 50% of tumors occur in the anal canal or rectum, and digital examination can detect the lesion for further diagnosis.

• Stool testing: Includes fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and fecal immunochemical test (FIT), which detect the presence of blood in stool.

- Endoscopic examination: Colonoscopy is the best method for diagnosing colorectal cancer, allowing direct visualization of the intestinal lining and enabling biopsy when necessary.

- Imaging tests: CT scans or MRI can be used to assess whether the cancer has locally invaded or metastasized.

• Tumor marker testing: Tumor markers such as CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) can assist in monitoring disease progression and treatment response.## Understanding Colon Cancer

## Six. Treatment Methods

- Surgical treatment: If the tumor is confined within the intestine and there is no distant organ metastasis, surgery is the most effective treatment. Depending on the tumor location and condition, partial or total intestinal resection via open or minimally invasive surgery is performed, along with temporary colostomy.

- Chemotherapy: Applicable for mid-to-late stage or metastatic colorectal cancer, it inhibits cancer cell growth and division.

- Radiotherapy: For rectal cancer patients, radiotherapy is commonly used pre- or post-surgery to shrink the tumor or reduce the risk of recurrence.

Targeted therapy and immunotherapy: Targeted drugs for specific gene mutations or therapies that enhance the immune system.

## Seven. Prevention Strategies

Healthy diet: Maintain a high-fiber, low-fat diet, and consume more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while reducing intake of red and processed meats.

Regular screening: Individuals aged 50–75 years can undergo a free fecal occult blood test every two years. High-risk groups, such as those with a family history of colorectal cancer, positive fecal occult blood test results, or obesity, should follow their physician's advice for follow-up checks every 1–3 years.

• Quit smoking and limit alcohol consumption

Maintain a healthy weight and engage in regular physical activity
