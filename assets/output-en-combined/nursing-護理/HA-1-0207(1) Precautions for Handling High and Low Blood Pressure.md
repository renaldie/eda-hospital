## Management of Hypotension and Hypertension

## One: What is Hypotension?

When the systolic pressure (the higher number) or diastolic pressure (the lower number) is lower than usual blood pressure by 20–30 mmHg, it indicates a possible state of hypotension.

## Two: Causes of Hypotension:

(1) Excessive fluid loss (fluid lost + urine output exceeds the amount of fluid consumed).

(2) Severe vomiting, diarrhea, or excessive sweating.

(3) Sudden loss of appetite and inability to eat.

(4) Overuse of blood pressure-lowering medications.

(5) During infection.

(6) When there are signs of bleeding in the body.

## Three: Symptoms of Hypotension:

Dizziness, fatigue, pale complexion, sweating, muscle cramps in the feet, tinnitus (especially due to excessive dehydration).

## Four: Management of Low Blood Pressure:

(1) Lie down immediately and rest.

(2) Supplement with saline solution.

(3) Recheck blood pressure after 10–15 minutes.

(4) Whether to reduce the dosage of blood pressure medication and the use of 2.5% or 4.25% dialysis fluid should be discussed with the nephrology or peritoneal dialysis team.

## Five: Precautions:

(1) After blood pressure stabilizes, slowly sit up and then measure blood pressure again. If blood pressure remains stable, sitting rest is acceptable. When blood pressure drops again, recommend lying down and resting until blood pressure stabilizes and no discomfort is present before getting up to move around.

(2) When measuring blood pressure, avoid wearing heavy clothing, and ensure the hand is at the same level as the heart to avoid affecting the accuracy of the reading.

(3) If a low blood pressure reading is obtained, immediately contact the peritoneal dialysis team to report the situation and seek advice.

## Six: What is Hypertension?

When the systolic pressure (the higher number) or diastolic pressure (the lower number) is higher than usual blood pressure by 20–30 mmHg, it indicates a possible state of elevated blood pressure.

## Seven: Causes of Hypertension:(1) Excessive intake of salt (salt, pickled foods, soy sauce, seasonings, candied foods, etc.).  
(2) Water intake exceeds water excretion.  
(3) Abnormal hormones in the body.  
(4) Related to emotions, stress, weather changes, insomnia, etc.  
(5) Failure to take antihypertensive medication as prescribed.

Eight. Methods to determine whether edema causes high blood pressure:  

(1) Whether there is swelling when pressing on the inner side of the lower leg (the area remains indented and does not quickly return to its original shape).  
(2) Whether body weight shows rapid increase.  
(3) Feeling shortness of breath when lying flat, but improved when sitting up.

Nine. Management of high blood pressure:  

(1) Measure blood pressure at the same time every day, monitor changes, and record them.  
(2) Systolic pressure should be maintained at 120–130 mmHg, and diastolic pressure at 70–80 mmHg.  
(3) Take antihypertensive medication as prescribed by the doctor and do not stop taking it without medical advice.  
(4) Proper dehydration: weigh yourself daily, check for swelling when pressing on the lower leg, to assess whether adequate dehydration has been achieved.  
(5) Maintain emotional stability, avoid emotional stress, ensure good sleep quality, and maintain a regular sleep schedule.  

(6) Adjust clothing according to weather changes and pay attention to warmth.  
(7) Engage in moderate physical activity to improve high blood pressure.  
(8) If edema is present, take diuretics as instructed by the doctor and increase fluid removal (use high-concentration glucose dialysis solutions as prescribed, such as 2.5% or 4.25% dialysis solutions).  
(9) In case of blood pressure rise, contact the peritoneal dialysis unit for consultation.

Ten. Dietary principles:  

(1) Adopt a light, low-salt diet using natural ingredients to enhance flavor, such as lemon, perilla, vinegar, etc.  
(2) Reduce intake of high-cholesterol foods.  
(3) Control fluid intake to avoid fluid retention in the body.
