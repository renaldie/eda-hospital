Patient Wound Care Guidelines and Precautions## One: Definition:

The heart is located slightly to the left side of the thoracic cavity and is responsible for supplying blood to the entire body. Cardiovascular diseases are generally initially treated with medical therapy; if medical treatment is ineffective or complications arise, surgical intervention may be considered. After surgery, you will have a surgical incision on your chest. The bones beneath the incision are secured with special wires (since the surgeon opens your sternum during the procedure). You may feel tightness or pain. These wires do not need to be removed after surgery and will not affect your daily activities. They will only be visible on X-rays (a small number of people may be allergic to the wires, in which case a separate surgery to remove them may be required). Some patients have their surgical sutures or staples removed before discharge, while others have them removed during a follow-up visit. Regardless of the method chosen, proper wound care is essential.

## Two: Applicable Population:

Patients with cardiovascular diseases that cannot be managed with medication or catheter-based treatments.

## Three: Post-Operative Precautions:

1. In the first week after surgery, the wound may become slightly swollen or painful—these are normal phenomena. Complete wound healing typically takes 6–8 weeks, while sternum healing requires about three months. During this period, avoid any activities involving chest expansion.

2. Your doctor will inform you when you can begin bathing. Before that, you must use sponge baths. Even if you are allowed to take showers, limit shower time to 10 minutes, keep the water temperature neither too hot nor too cold to avoid dizziness. Additionally, avoid rubbing the wound vigorously until it is fully healed.

3. Before discharge, arrange for yourself or a family member to care for the wound, and prepare the following items: sterile cotton swabs, povidone-iodine, gauze, and paper tape. After daily bathing or showering, use a sterile cotton swab dipped in povidone-iodine to gently clean the wound from top to bottom (to remove any dirt). Do not rub back and forth, and do not apply any non-prescribed medications or substances to the wound without your doctor’s approval, as this may impair wound healing. To promote wound healing, smooth appearance, and prevent splitting, you may use cosmetic tape according to your individual condition for 4–6 weeks. The tape does not need to be changed daily; simply replace it when it naturally falls off or becomes contaminated. However, if redness or blisters appear on the skin, stop using it immediately to avoid discomfort and infection.

4. If you notice redness, swelling, heat, unusual pain, or yellow or green discharge from the wound, accompanied by fever, these may be signs of infection. You should seek medical attention promptly.
