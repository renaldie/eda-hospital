## I. Postoperative Complications

Patients undergoing lumbar surgery may experience complications such as wound inflammation, infection, or nerve damage.

## II. Postoperative Care

1. After surgery, pay close attention to changes in arm and leg nerve function. If you experience numbness, weakness, or reduced mobility, notify medical staff immediately.

2. Be careful to avoid pulling or tugging at the drainage tubes on your body. Keep the wound dry and closely monitor the dressing for any signs of blood or pale yellow fluid leakage. If leakage is observed, notify medical staff immediately.

3. Nursing staff will assess your urination and defecation every 2–4 hours and monitor for signs of urinary retention.

4. After surgery, pain and discomfort due to swelling at the surgical site pressing on nerve roots are common. Inform the nursing staff so that appropriate pain medication can be administered as needed.

5. The wound is sutured out 7–10 days after surgery. After removal, use cosmetic adhesive tape for protection. Increase intake of high-protein and high-vitamin foods to promote wound healing.

### 1. Bed Rest Precautions:

(1) Follow the doctor's instructions regarding when to get out of bed. If you are still required to remain in bed for within 48 hours after surgery, change positions at least every 2 hours using the rolling method (Figure 1). If using a commode on the bed, ensure the buttocks are not elevated. When lying flat, place a pillow under the head and another under the knees to maintain spinal alignment. With the doctor's permission and if no discomfort is felt, gradually elevate the head of the bed to prevent orthostatic hypotension, but be cautious not to press on the surgical site.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_61_732_478_938.jpg" alt="Image" width="17%" /></div>

Step the opposite foot onto the bed, then turn over

Rolling method for position change (maintain spinal alignment in a straight line)

<div style="text-align: center;">Figure 1. Schematic illustration of the rolling method for position change</div>

(2) Bedside activities: During bed rest, hip and knee joint movements can be gradually increased within the pain tolerance range of the surgical wound. Movements of the upper limbs, feet, and ankles do not affect the affected area and should be performed as much as possible, at least five times per day, to prevent deep vein thrombosis.

### 2. Correct Posture Transitions:

(1) During hospitalization to reduce wound pain:

a. Raise the head of the bed to maintain the stability and alignment of the surgical area.

b. Turn to the side and sit at the edge of the bed, supporting the bed surface with both hands.

c. Family members assist in protecting the patient.

1. Proper wearing of back brace:

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_20_251_344_600.jpg" alt="Image" width="13%" /></div>

(1) The back brace should be worn outside of clothing.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_2_605_320_756.jpg" alt="Image" width="13%" /></div>

(2) The elastic straps should be tightened to about one finger width.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_0_760_325_1052.jpg" alt="Image" width="13%" /></div>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_5_1058_326_1451.jpg" alt="Image" width="13%" /></div>

(3) Do not wear it too low, as this may compress the inguinal region; the upper part of the buttocks should be comfortably supported.

(4) The main steel plates should be symmetrically fixed on both sides of the lower back and lumbar vertebrae.

Wear the back brace before getting out of bed.  
Please follow the doctor's instructions regarding the duration of wearing the back brace.  
No need to wear the back brace while sleeping or bathing.

2. Activity-related precautions:

(1) Avoid sudden or forceful twisting of the waist.  
(2) Take a shower to maintain a straight lumbar spine.  
(3) It is only safe to drive a car or ride a motorcycle after 3 to 4 weeks post-surgery.  
(4) Avoid pushing, pulling, lifting, or carrying heavy objects, as well as long-distance travel or prolonged sitting.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1996_168_2381_510.jpg" alt="Image" width="16%" /></div>

3. Maintain proper posture

(1) Using the two-leg method:

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1185_744_1381_1245.jpg" alt="Image" width="8%" /></div>

a. When standing, tuck the chin, lift the head, keep the back straight, contract the abdominal muscles, and tighten the pelvis to reduce pressure on the back.  
b. Only after evaluation by a doctor can you determine whether to adopt a squatting posture to pick up items.  
c. When lifting objects, separate your legs, squat down, tighten your glutes and abdominal muscles, bring your body close to the object, keep your lumbar spine straight, and lower your pelvis—let your gluteal and leg muscles bear the weight of the object.  
d. Wear flat shoes, avoid sandals and high heels, to maintain body balance.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1829_1346_2152_1624.jpg" alt="Image" width="13%" /></div>## (2) Lying on the bed posture:

a. When lying on the side, bend the knee joints.

b. When lying on the back, place a pillow under the knees, and use a flat pillow under the head to avoid tension in the shoulders, neck, and arms.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_691_106_974_291.jpg" alt="Image" width="11%" /></div>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_750_342_1021_490.jpg" alt="Image" width="11%" /></div>

c. Avoid the prone position, as this posture causes the back to sink and leads to tension in the shoulders and neck.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_734_510_966_656.jpg" alt="Image" width="9%" /></div>

d. When getting on or off the bed, maintain a straight line of the lumbar spine, and ensure the back brace is worn before getting off the bed.

(3) Proper sitting posture:

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_41_851_202_1046.jpg" alt="Image" width="6%" /></div>

a. The chair should have a solid backrest. The width and height of the chair should be appropriate so that both legs naturally bend and hang freely to the ground, with the knee joints ideally higher than the hip joints.

b. Avoid low and soft chairs, such as soft sofas or low stools.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_615_1092_950_1231.jpg" alt="Image" width="14%" /></div>

c. Do not sit abruptly on the chair; avoid prolonged sitting (more than 30 minutes), and contract the abdominal muscles to straighten the back, keeping the neck and back in a straight line as much as possible.

d. When driving, keep the seat backrest at a reasonable distance from the steering wheel, and fasten the seat belt or use a firm backrest.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_863_1204_1111_1673.jpg" alt="Image" width="10%" /></div>

## Five. Rehabilitation exercises:

1. Begin practicing the basic rehabilitation exercises from the initial stage of the teaching sheet before surgery. Advanced rehabilitation exercises are performed only after being assessed and guided by a therapist during hospitalization, and can be continued after discharge and returning home.

2. When wearing a back brace, if the back panel causes discomfort at the surgical wound, place a towel inside the back panel. The soft towel can reduce wound pain and improve comfort.

3. During exercise, follow the principle of not causing pain at the surgical wound. If pain occurs, consult a physical therapist to adjust the exercise plan.

4. If dizziness or discomfort occurs, pause the exercise to prevent falls. Exercise intensity should be tailored to individual conditions and should not be excessive, as overexertion may cause pain at the surgical wound.

5. Benefits of exercise: After surgery, combining rehabilitation exercises with recovery can improve surgical success rates and reduce the recurrence of back pain.

6. Exercise prescription: Hold each exercise for 10–15 seconds, then relax. Perform 15 repetitions, four times a day.

## Post-surgical nutrition promotes faster wound healing and reduces body aches and pains

The key to diet after spinal surgery lies in bone and muscle recovery.  
Consuming high-quality protein, calcium, iron, zinc, and vitamins helps wound healing and maintains healthy muscles and bones.  
Moreover, due to reduced physical activity post-surgery, adequate dietary fiber intake is essential to promote gut health!
