<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1044_951_1428_1107.jpg" alt="Image" width="22%" /></div>## A Peaceful and Safe Heart

It is only through the convergence of circumstances that we are able to gather here today. When the time comes for these circumstances to end, that will be the moment when we say goodbye to each other! Although we may not have been able to get along well in the past, we hope that at this final moment we can make the most of it, so that both of us can find peace in life and death.

Just like the rising and setting of the sun, even with all the sorrow and pain, we must accompany each other through the final journey of life. We are willing to help you care for your beloved family members and assist them in drawing a perfect conclusion at the end of their life journey.

## Physical Care

## (1) Consciousness Status:

As people approach the end of life, some may be conscious and alert, sometimes closing their eyes to rest, with increased sleep duration. Some may experience delirium, such as talking to themselves, appearing blank-eyed, greeting the air, conversing with past relatives, mentioning events or people they care about, waving their hands in the air, or grasping objects. Some people may emit regular moans when breathing out, while others may be restless and agitated, shouting or wanting to get up and walk around.

## Care Preparation:

$ ^{*} $ Pay close attention to safety and prevent accidents, such as falls.

* For patients who show signs of anxiety, discuss the use of sedatives with a doctor.

* Listen carefully and understand the meaning of these messages to the patient, giving them the opportunity to express their inner world.

* Do not agree with the patient's unrealistic hallucinations, but also do not directly deny them. Instead, gently and patiently help them recognize each person around them and familiar or beloved things.

(2) Fatigue and Weakness:Unable to speak, eat, open eyes, or focus when conversing with others; appears drowsy and gradually enters an unconscious state.

## Care Preparation:

$ ^{*} $ At this stage, assist the patient with turning or massage, but avoid forcing the patient to get up or waking them up.

## (3) The Gurgling Sound Near Death (loud sounds during breathing):

1. **Breathing**: May involve mouth breathing, with irregular speed and depth—sometimes rapid, sometimes slow, occasionally stopping for several seconds. It may resemble sighing, then becoming forceful before weakening, and occurring intermittently.

2. This sound is caused by secretions in the mouth that the patient cannot cough out due to weakness, or by increased secretions in the lungs, which may be mistakenly believed to indicate excessive phlegm.

## Care Preparation:

$ ^{*} $ Try elevating the head or positioning the patient on their side to change posture and alleviate symptoms.

$ ^{*} $ Use cotton swabs to remove oral secretions.

$ ^{*} $ Apply cool, moist steam to thin secretions, making them easier to expel.

$ ^{*} $ This is a significant sign near the end of life. At this stage, according to local customs, end-of-life preparations may be made.

## (4) Pulse:

Weaker, faster, or irregular; sometimes present and sometimes absent; the pulse may not be detectable when pressure is applied.

## (5) Vision:

Vision gradually blurs, eyes become dull and unfocused, gaze fixed forward, eyes cannot fully close during sleep, eyes drooping downward, and conjunctival edema (known as "lychee eyes").

## (6) Hearing:

Hearing is the last sense to fade. The patient may still perceive surrounding sounds, but is unable to respond or react.

## Care Preparation:

* When family or friends visit, hold the patient's hand, sit beside them, and introduce yourself, expressing gratitude and offering comfort to help the patient feel at ease. Avoid pulling on the patient or asking them to respond.

* Avoid loud noises; instead, play the patient's preferred soft or religious music.

## (7) Taste:

1. Dry mouth, bitter taste, altered taste, increased sensitivity, difficulty swallowing, burning sensation at the back of the tongue, increased tongue coating, angular cheilitis, and dry, cracked lips.

2. Due to the gradual decline in organ function, the patient may experience reduced appetite or complete loss of appetite. Additionally, due to diminished swallowing ability, refusal to eat may occur.## Care Preparation:

$ ^{*} $ Maintain oral hygiene to prevent oral inflammation; use lip balm or petroleum jelly to keep lips moisturized.

$ ^{*} $ Wet the toothbrush with water to moisten the lips and increase humidity.

$ ^{*} $ Do not force patients to eat; offer only what they request.

* There is no need to worry about patients going hungry! The body knows its limits—when nutrients are no longer needed, appetite naturally diminishes and eating becomes difficult.

$ ^{*} $ If a patient is unable or unwilling to eat, do not force them to eat, as this may increase their distress.

## (8) Swallowing Difficulties:

Reduced intake of water and food during the end-of-life stage helps patients adjust to the dying process.

## Care Preparation:

* When patients lose the ability to swallow, moisten the oral cavity with a cotton swab dipped in warm water, or apply lip balm to the lips to increase moisture.

## (9) Elimination:

Constipation, incontinence of urine or feces, decreasing urine output, darkening of urine color, or urinary retention may occur.

## Care Preparation:

$ ^{*}$ Use diapers to maintain patient comfort and clean them regularly, but obtain the patient’s consent first.

* Prevent odor: pay attention to body hygiene, especially in the urinary organs, skin folds, and wounds. Place aromatic essential oils, coffee grounds, or tea渣 beside the bed.

## (10) Skin:

1. Due to severe weakness and inability to absorb nutrients, the skin and muscles throughout the body may become dull, lack luster, soft, and lose elasticity, or show symptoms such as night sweats, bruising, edema, and cold extremities.

2. Due to slow blood circulation, patients may experience elevated body temperature, cold hands and feet, and dark or purple nails or lips. These symptoms generally do not cause discomfort to the patient.

## Care Preparation:

$ ^{*} $ If a patient is sweating excessively or has a fever, help them take a bath, change into clean clothes, and discuss the use of antipyretics with a doctor.

$ ^{*} $ Keep clothes and bed linens smooth to prevent pressure sores.

$ ^{*} $ Use a neutral lotion to maintain smooth and even skin, prevent skin cracking and pressure sores. Gently massage the skin and move joints to reduce discomfort caused by skin breakdown, pressure sores, and muscle spasms.$ ^{*} $ Turn the patient regularly or use a foam mattress to reduce skin pressure.

## (11) Pain:

Some patients may experience pain.

## Care Preparation:

$ ^{*} $ Patients who are unconscious may sometimes also feel pain.

$ ^{*} $ Discuss the use of pain medication with a doctor.

## (12) When life is nearing its end:

1. Vision will gradually become blurred, and sensations of pain and discomfort may slightly decrease.

2. The long illness process or experience often leads most patients to realize that death is approaching, resulting in a sense of impending death.

3. When patients exhibit self-reflection on their lives (e.g., elderly patients mentioning they want to go back to work in the fields), engage with them to jointly recall their past life experiences to reduce confusion.

4. Remain calm, speak gently and confidently to reduce anxiety.

5. Family members can prepare religious rituals according to the patient's religious beliefs in the final stages of life.

6. The room should be quiet with appropriate lighting.

## Psychological and Spiritual Care

1. Respect the patient's decisions and strive to alleviate their pain and discomfort.

2. Inform the patient and family that most people can die peacefully without suffering.

3. Caregivers should maintain a calm and composed demeanor and expression to reduce the patient's anxiety.

4. Acknowledge the patient's achievements and contributions to family and society. Invite religious figures or respected elders to guide the patient in expressing concerns or regrets.

5. Family members should communicate and coordinate with each other, make arrangements for end-of-life care and funeral planning, and contact funeral homes, mortuaries, temples, churches, and arrange procedures for cremation or burial.

6. Patiently accompany and gently care for the patient to help them pass away peacefully and calmly.

7. While grieving, it is also important to help the patient clean up and complete their final journey with dignity.

8. If the disease is no longer treatable and death is inevitable, the patient needs palliative care to ensure a dignified end.### 9. Specific practices for a peaceful passing aim to achieve three kinds of peace:

(1) Physical peace.

(2) Psychological peace.

(3) Spiritual peace.

## Grief Care

After a loved one passes away, you or your family may experience the following reactions:

1. Accepting the reality and emotions of loss: You may feel confused due to loss, find it difficult to concentrate, want or actually cry intensely, feel uneasy, sad, helpless, painful, abandoned, angry, feel that the situation is unreal, have difficulty controlling yourself, lack of security, fear, anxiety, search for the deceased, reminisce about the deceased, miss the deceased, feel as if the deceased still exists, hear the deceased's voice or see hallucinations, have trouble sleeping due to nightmares.

2. Physical discomfort: numbness, throat tightness, shortness of breath, chest tightness, nausea, weakness, digestive issues, insomnia, unstable blood pressure, blurred vision, headaches, weight loss, weakened immunity, hormonal imbalance, lack of energy, emptiness, diarrhea or constipation, dizziness, etc.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1121_951_1498_1123.jpg" alt="Image" width="22%" /></div>## You can try releasing and expressing emotions; methods to alleviate grief include:

1. You can cry out loud and avoid suppressing your emotions.

2. You can talk about things related to the deceased.

3. You can look at old photos, relive joyful and painful memories, and find emotional comfort.

4. Under a doctor's prescription, you can use sedatives or antidepressants at appropriate times to ease grief-related emotions.

4. You can call someone who can listen to you speak.

5. Depending on the child's condition, you can try discussing the reality of the patient's death with them, without hiding or evading the topic, because children will not stop thinking about death or the deceased.

</div>

## End-of-life care

1. Prepare a basin, towel, warm water, paper tape, gauze (as needed), a clean set of clothes that can be easily put on and taken off, and diapers.

2. Gently bathe the patient with warm water to clean their body, ideally while explaining the process to them.

3. If the eyes cannot close, gently tell the patient to "rest peacefully" near the ear, or use paper tape to cover them. After rigor mortis sets in, remove the tape gently; it should be removed after 8 hours (staff from funeral services can assist with this).

4. If the mouth cannot close, place a folded towel or cloth roll under the chin, and slightly elevate the head to tilt the neck forward so that the mouth naturally closes (remove after 8 hours).

5. To prevent gastric contents from flowing out when moving the body, place a large towel under the head and shoulders during cleaning to facilitate wiping and avoid soiling clothing with gastric contents.

6. If there is swelling or skin rupture, use a care pad or towel to wrap the swollen area to prevent exudate from soaking through clean clothes.

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1388_981_1678_1122.jpg" alt="Image" width="17%" />
</div>7. To prevent incontinence of urine or feces from contaminating the body, it is necessary to first put on disposable nappies, then dress the deceased in clothes, shoes, socks, and other items prepared by family members.

8. According to the instructions of medical and nursing staff, remove various tubes from the body, such as urinary catheters, tracheostomy tubes, and nasogastric tubes (before removal, aspirate gastric contents first).

9. If the deceased used dentures, they can be placed back in the mouth to maintain a complete appearance.

10. If necessary, light makeup can be applied to make the deceased's appearance more peaceful.

Family members may offer a farewell message to the deceased, such as: "Thank you for your contributions to the family and for the love shown by family members toward the patient; please let go and say goodbye, and follow your faith (God, Buddha, etc.) as you leave..."

## Issuance of Death Certificate

How to obtain a death certificate due to illness or natural death:

(1) Patients who pass away in the hospital:

For patients who pass away in the hospital, the medical team in charge during hospitalization will issue the death certificate.

Approximately 10 copies of the death certificate are required (the number can be increased according to family needs).

## (2) Patients who pass away at home:

[If the patient is returned home due to critical condition, remember! Before discharge, apply to the medical team for a critical condition diagnosis certificate.]

Prepare a clean white sheet of paper. Have immediate family members or a spouse record the year, month, day, hour, and minute of the patient's death. Carry with you the death time certificate, critical condition diagnosis certificate, original identity card of the deceased, original household registration book, and official seals, and request a medical professional from the village health center or local practicing medical institution to conduct a post-mortem examination and assist in issuing the certificate.
