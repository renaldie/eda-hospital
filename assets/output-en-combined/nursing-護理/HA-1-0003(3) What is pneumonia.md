Saturated fats, such as vegetable oils. This can increase caloric intake while reducing respiratory burden.

(4) Consume sufficient fruits and vegetables, develop regular bowel habits, and prevent constipation to avoid obstructing respiration.

### 3. Preventing Infection

(1) Receive influenza vaccine or pneumococcal vaccine.

(2) During flu outbreaks or when the body's immunity is weakened, avoid public places and refrain from contact with individuals who have colds.

(3) Maintain good nutritional status, ensure adequate sleep, and engage in moderate physical activity to enhance immunity.

(4) Adjust clothing appropriately to avoid catching a cold.

(5) Recognize signs of infection: such as increased sputum volume, yellow or thick sputum, fever, cough, worsening respiratory difficulty, or confusion and drowsiness. If any of these symptoms occur, seek medical attention immediately.

## 1. What is pneumonia?

Pneumonia is an acute inflammation of the lungs, which can occur in all age groups, especially in individuals with weakened immune function, such as the elderly, alcoholics, or patients with diabetes. Although antibiotics are available for treatment, the incidence remains high and pneumonia can be fatal.

## 2. Causes

1. Infectious: caused by bacterial, viral, or other microbial infections.

2. Non-infectious: such as exposure to toxic gases or chemicals, aspiration of water, food, or vomit, or autoimmune-related diseases.

3. Impaired protective mechanisms: such as inhibition of mucus-ciliary clearance, for example due to smoking or congenital diseases.

4. Presence of risk factors: older age, swallowing difficulties, long-term bed rest, cancer, or obstructive lung diseases, which lead to increased secretion or impaired clearance of secretions from the lungs.

## 3. Examination

1. Physical examination.

2. Chest X-ray.

3. Sputum culture.

4. Arterial blood gas analysis.

## 4. Common symptoms

1. Fever, fatigue, chills, muscle pain, headache, vomiting, diarrhea.

2. Shortness of breath, chest pain, progressive respiratory difficulty.

3. Cough (dry or productive cough).

4. Increased sputum volume with color changes, possibly with blood streaks, appearing rust-colored or green, or becoming more viscous.

5. Anxiety, restlessness, or altered mental status.

## 5. Home care

1. Do not adjust medication dosage on your own, and pay close attention to any of the following drug side effects: vomiting, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, tachycardia, arrhythmia, tremors, insomnia, seizures, shock, skin rashes, gastrointestinal discomfort, etc. If any of these symptoms occur, inform your doctor immediately.

2. Diet: Adequate nutrition can enhance the body's resistance. A high-protein, high-calorie diet is recommended. If there are dietary restrictions due to other medical conditions, consult your doctor or a nutritionist. Pay attention to fluid intake. The following dietary principles may be helpful:

(1) Choose simple, varied, and easy-to-prepare foods, such as salty porridge.

(2) Eat small, frequent meals; avoid overeating at each meal. Take a rest before meals and avoid lying down after meals.

(3) In terms of energy provision, increase the intake of unprocessed foods in the diet, such as nuts, oils, and other high-energy foods.
