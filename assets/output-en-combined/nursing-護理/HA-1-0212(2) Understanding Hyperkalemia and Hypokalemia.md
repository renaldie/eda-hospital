## Understanding Hyperkalemia and Hypokalemia

|  | Hyperkalemia | Hypokalemia |
|---|---|---|
| Definition | Blood potassium concentration greater than 5.5 meq/L is considered hyperkalemia | Blood potassium concentration less than 3.5 meq/L is considered hypokalemia |
| Causes | (1) Excessive intake of high-potassium foods<br>(2) Chronic constipation<br>(3) Inadequate dialysis volume<br>(4) Tissue damage: muscle injury, burns, etc.<br>(5) Hemolysis<br>(6) Gastrointestinal bleeding<br>(7) Medications: Traditional Chinese herbal medicines, potassium-sparing diuretics, certain antihypertensive drugs, etc. | (1) Inadequate potassium intake:<br>1. Insufficient consumption of vegetables and fruits<br>2. Continued use of steaming cooking methods for vegetables<br>3. Poor appetite and low food intake<br>(2) Severe diarrhea leading to excessive loss of potassium through the gastrointestinal tract |
| Symptoms | (1) Cardiovascular: Hypotension, arrhythmia, ECG changes, ventricular fibrillation, cardiac arrest<br>(2) Muscular: Early symptoms include muscle tremors, cramps, and abnormal sensations; severe cases present with muscle weakness and paralysis<br>(3) Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, increased intestinal motility, diarrhea, abdominal pain, etc. | (1) Cardiovascular: Prone to arrhythmias<br>(2) Muscular: Muscle weakness, muscle paralysis<br>(3) Gastrointestinal: Slowed intestinal motility, prone to constipation |
| Management | (1) Control high-potassium diet:<br>1. Avoid consuming cocoa powder, strong tea, three-in-one coffee, juice, herbal medicine juice, energy drinks<br>2. Avoid chicken seasoning, beef broth, fish broth, pork bone broth, hot pot broth, and thickened soups<br>3. Do not use low-sodium salt or thin soy sauce, as they replace sodium with potassium, which may lead to elevated potassium levels<br>4. Avoid high-potassium fruits such as strawberries, tomatoes, honeydew melon, papaya, watermelon, and kiwi; fruit juices and preserved fruits are also high in potassium and should be avoided<br>5. Before cooking greens, blanch them in boiling water for 3 to 5 minutes, then remove and proceed with cooking | (1) Increase intake of potassium-rich foods, primarily focusing on vegetables and fruits<br>(2) Cook vegetables thoroughly by stir-frying; no need for additional blanching<br>(3) If experiencing gastrointestinal discomfort such as severe vomiting or diarrhea, seek medical attention immediately<br>(4) Take oral potassium supplements as prescribed by a doctor ||  | (二) Daily routine and adequate dialysis<br>(三) Normal daily bowel movements<br>(四) Adjust dialysis regimen as prescribed by physician (considering automated peritoneal dialysis or manual multiple exchanges)<br>(五) Use potassium-lowering medications as instructed by doctor |  |

| **Notes** | If symptoms of suspected hyperkalemia occur, this is an emergency and medical attention should be sought immediately. | Long-term hypokalemia and constipation can alter intestinal permeability and lead to peritonitis. |
