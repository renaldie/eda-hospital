</div>## Two. Understanding Total Hip Replacement

## One. Introduction

The hip joint is the joint connecting the pelvis and thigh, composed of the acetabulum and femoral head. It is a crucial joint for walking and daily movement. When the hip joint is damaged to the point of causing pain during walking and weakness in the affected limb, severe cases may result in difficulty walking. Initial outpatient management typically involves medication and physical therapy. If pain or deformity persists despite medication and rehabilitation, leading to impaired mobility, total hip replacement surgery is required.

## Two. What is Total Hip Replacement?

A total artificial hip joint is designed to mimic the human hip joint structure and replace a diseased or damaged joint. It consists of an artificial acetabular component, an artificial femoral head, an artificial acetabular liner, and an artificial femoral stem. This construct provides a more stable hip joint, effectively reducing pain and improving joint mobility.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1408_540_2086_947.jpg" alt="Image" width="28%" /></div>

## Three. Indications

1. Congenital hip dysplasia  
2. Degenerative hip arthritis  
3. Rheumatoid hip arthritis  
4. Traumatic hip arthritis  
5. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head  
6. Femoral neck fracture

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_78_233_1101_1613.jpg" alt="Image" width="42%" /></div>


## IV. Preoperative Preparation

## 1. Preparation of Equipment

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1288_288_1735_584.jpg" alt="Image" width="18%" /></div>


## (1) Walker

It is recommended that patients get up and move as early as possible after surgery. Medical and nursing staff will teach patients how to use assistive devices to get out of bed.

## (2) Ice Pack

Used for icing the surgical wound post-operation to prevent swelling of the affected limb and alleviate pain.

## (3) Personal Medications

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1817_578_2242_875.jpg" alt="Image" width="17%" /></div>


Please bring your regularly taken medications, along with the medication bottles and packaging, to the hospital on the day of admission and hand them over to the nursing staff. This will allow medical and nursing personnel to understand your medication history. If you are taking anticoagulant medications (such as anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents) or glucose-lowering medications (such as SGLT2 inhibitors), please follow the doctor's instructions to take or discontinue them, and proactively inform the medical and nursing staff.

(4) Medical Grade Compression Socks  
Worn after surgery, these socks can help prevent deep vein thrombosis in the lower limbs.

## (5) Signing of Relevant Consent Forms

✓ Surgical Consent Form  
✓ Anesthesia Consent Form  
✓ Pre-anesthesia Assessment Form  
✓ Self-paid Service Consent Form

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1715_1289_2284_1634.jpg" alt="Image" width="23%" /></div>## Two. How to discontinue anticoagulant medications before surgery?

Since anticoagulant medications prolong coagulation time, if you are scheduled for total joint replacement surgery, you should proactively inform your doctor about which anticoagulant medication you are currently taking. The surgical physician will assess whether preoperative discontinuation of the medication is necessary. You may also visit your original prescribing physician to confirm whether it is acceptable to discontinue the medication and for how long. Therefore, please follow your doctor's instructions regarding anticoagulant use and proactively inform medical staff of whether you have discontinued the medication and on what date. Do not discontinue the medication on your own, as this may lead to insufficient discontinuation duration and increased bleeding risk, or prolonged discontinuation leading to thromboembolic events.

## Three. Preoperative Information

1. Blood tests, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, and pre-anesthesia evaluation will be completed on the day of admission.

2. To prevent aspiration pneumonia during surgery due to vomiting, patients must fast for 8 hours before surgery. Medical staff will inform you of the fasting time after 9 p.m. Fasting includes all food, water, and any chewable items such as chewing gum, betel nut, or candy.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_753_875_1037_1055.jpg" alt="Image" width="11%" /></div>

3. On the day before or on the day of surgery, patients should bathe their affected limb and body.

4. Before surgery, the surgeon will mark the surgical site. Before entering the operating room, medical staff will perform local cleaning of the surgical site and cover it with a dressing.

5. The surgery typically lasts about 4–6 hours, depending on individual anesthesia methods and recovery time. For patients undergoing general anesthesia, a breathing tube will be placed in the throat during anesthesia to assist with breathing, which may cause throat discomfort or mild blood-tinged sputum. Drinking small amounts of warm water frequently can help alleviate these symptoms. However, if fresh blood is continuously coughed up, patients should immediately inform medical staff for assistance.

6. A family member must accompany the patient throughout the entire surgical procedure and during the transfer back to the hospital room.

## Four. Preoperative Rehabilitation Exercise Preparation

## I. Postoperative Limb Positioning and Care Instructions

1. After surgery, we will assist you in naturally extending your legs outward and place a pillow (triangular pillow) between your legs to keep your feet apart, achieving at least a 30-degree external rotation of the hip joints to prevent dislocation.

2. To prevent swelling, pain, and impaired peripheral circulation in the affected limb, a pillow can be used to elevate the surgical leg, which helps reduce edema.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_2_548_458_861.jpg" alt="Image" width="19%" /></div>

<div style="text-align: center;">Lying Flat</div>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_535_550_967_861.jpg" alt="Image" width="18%" /></div>

<div style="text-align: center;">Lying on Side</div>

3. Apply ice to the surgical site to reduce pain and swelling. Frequently change the ice application site to avoid impaired blood circulation. Ice application should be stopped after bedtime.

4. To prevent postoperative fever and inadequate lung expansion, patients should perform deep breathing and coughing exercises regularly. Medical staff will assist in teaching patients to turn and pat their back every 2 hours (avoiding the waist and spine). Patients should also increase fluid intake—aiming for 2000–3000 ml per day (except for patients with fluid restrictions).

5. Raise the head of the bed by approximately 30–45 degrees to facilitate eating and prevent vomiting-induced aspiration.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_364_1382_689_1620.jpg" alt="Image" width="13%" /></div>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_720_1381_1030_1625.jpg" alt="Image" width="13%" /></div>

## II. Tube Placement Precautions

## (1) Indwelling Catheter

1. For safety during postoperative activity, an indwelling catheter will be placed after surgery.

2. Medical staff will assess the appropriate time for catheter removal.

3. The catheter will be secured on the inner thigh (in females) or lower abdomen (in males).

4. The urine collection bag must be positioned below the bladder.  
Placing it above the bladder may lead to urine reflux and infection. The bottom of the bag should be at least 3 cm above the ground to avoid contact with the floor.

5. If you notice a persistent decrease in urine output or bladder pain, check whether the catheter is kinked and seek medical staff assistance for handling.

At least 3 cm above the ground

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1846_469_2319_908.jpg" alt="Image" width="19%" /></div>

## (2) Drain Tube

1. A drain tube will be placed at the surgical site on the affected limb to drain blood and prevent hematoma formation.

2. During the period of tube placement, in addition to preventing dislodgement, the Y-shaped connector should be frequently squeezed. Ice application should be avoided over the drain tube to prevent blood clot formation and blockage.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1809_990_2317_1343.jpg" alt="Image" width="21%" /></div>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1814_1352_2331_1652.jpg" alt="Image" width="21%" /></div>3. You should turn frequently or get out of bed to move around, to facilitate drainage of blood. If the drainage tube rapidly swells, it may indicate excessive blood volume or air leakage in the tubing; please immediately inform the medical or nursing staff for assessment.

4. Since the drainage tube operates under negative pressure suction, it can be placed directly on the bed without needing to be hung at the bedside. However, it should be avoided from being folded back. When getting out of bed, you can secure the tube to your clothing to prevent pulling on the tubing and causing dislodgement.

5. The timing for removing the drainage tube varies depending on individual drainage volume. If removal is required, a physician will work together with a specialist nurse to assist with the procedure.

## Three: Dietary Guidance

1. After returning to the ward, if there are no symptoms such as dizziness or vomiting, adopt a gradual dietary progression: first try drinking a small amount of plain water. If no vomiting occurs, you may consume liquid foods (such as fruit juice) one hour later, followed by soft, easily digestible foods (such as porridge), and by the next day, you can return to normal eating. This gradual dietary progression helps prevent digestive discomfort caused by slowed intestinal motility due to anesthesia.

2. Eat more vitamin C-rich fruits such as kiwi, cherries, and grapes, as well as high-protein foods such as chicken, duck, fish, and beef, to promote wound healing. Also consume high-fiber foods such as green vegetables to prevent constipation.

3. Remember to eat in a semi-upright or sitting position, as eating while lying down increases the risk of aspiration and subsequent aspiration pneumonia.

## (I) Prophylactic Antibiotics

1. Surgical prophylactic antibiotics refer to the administration of antibiotics to patients before surgery, prior to wound contamination or infection, in order to prevent postoperative infections.

2. Possible side effects such as allergies or gastrointestinal discomfort—such as skin rash, itching, or diarrhea—should be reported immediately to the medical team if they occur.

## (II) Antithrombotic Medications

1. To prevent the development of deep vein thrombosis, the physician will assess the patient's condition and decide whether to prescribe antithrombotic medications (such as anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents) after surgery.

2. If you have a history of gastrointestinal bleeding or peptic ulcers, please inform the medical team in advance.

3. During medication use, if you are scheduled to undergo any surgical procedures, tooth extraction, endoscopy, or other procedures that may cause bleeding, please inform your doctor in advance about your current use of these medications.

4. While taking antithrombotic medications, be cautious during daily activities to avoid injury. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and an electric razor when brushing teeth or shaving.

5. Possible side effects include gastrointestinal discomfort or bleeding reactions (such as hematoma at the surgical site, gingival bleeding, unexplained bruising, hematuria, melena, or black stools). If any bleeding symptoms occur, please visit the clinic immediately and inform the medical team.

6. If you have been receiving antithrombotic therapy prior to joint replacement surgery and have already discontinued the medication before surgery after discussion with your original prescribing physician, please discuss with your surgical physician regarding the timing of restarting antithrombotic therapy after surgery.

## VI. Pain Management

## I. The Impact of Pain

Pain is a subjective sensation of suffering, which may be continuous or intermittent, and may manifest as dull, sharp, or stabbing pain. Physiologically, patients may experience anxiety, insomnia, reduced appetite, tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and endocrine dysfunction. Pain may also reduce respiratory rate (especially in upper abdominal or thoracic surgeries, where pain intensifies with breathing), lead to reluctance to get out of bed and thus cause inadequate lung expansion, increasing the risk of venous thromboembolism and other complications, ultimately delaying discharge.

Only you can describe your pain. Be brave and tell your doctor or nurse about your pain concerns. With correct expression and assessment methods, 90% of pain can be effectively relieved.

## What You Can Do:

1. You can describe the location of your pain or point to the area with your hand.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1694_876_2323_1168.jpg" alt="Image" width="26%" /></div>

2. Inform the medical staff when your pain first started, how often it occurs, and how long each episode lasts.

3. Clearly describe the sensation of your pain—for example, dull, sharp, or stabbing pain?

4. Inform the medical team whether your pain has affected your daily routine—for example, inability to sleep.

5. Express your pain score accurately. We recommend using a "Pain Assessment Scale" to describe your pain: 0 points means no pain, and 10 points represents unbearable pain.## II. Common postoperative pain relief methods

## Say "pain" boldly — refuse postoperative pain

## Common postoperative pain relief methods include the following:

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_61_426_245_671.jpg" alt="Image" width="7%" /></div>

**Oral medication**: For mild pain, take medication as instructed by your doctor. Even if you currently feel no pain, continue taking the medication to achieve better pain control.

## Intramuscular or intravenous injection (non-steroidal or morphine-based analgesics):

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1_728_323_1032.jpg" alt="Image" width="13%" /></div>

Individuals vary in their pain tolerance and drug absorption, and the duration is limited. These medications must be administered at fixed intervals as directed by your doctor, or used for sudden, acute pain.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_20_1079_324_1294.jpg" alt="Image" width="12%" /></div>

**Multimodal analgesia**: The anesthesiologist evaluates and selects the appropriate administration method and route. Medication can be delivered via machine, intravenously, or locally, with safe dosing and locked-in timing to allow patients to choose their preferred method.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_35_1341_313_1634.jpg" alt="Image" width="11%" /></div>

**Nerve block procedure**: Under ultrasound guidance, the exact location of the nerve is precisely identified, and local anesthetic is injected around the nerve to temporarily numb it, providing pain relief for 6–8 hours. The affected limb may experience numbness, tingling, or muscle weakness, which will resolve once the drug effect wears off.

## III. Non-pharmacological methods to alleviate pain

1. Distract yourself from pain through activities such as listening to music, playing cards, or going for a walk.  
2. Maintain a relaxed and positive mindset — for example, having companionship from family or friends can provide psychological support and help reduce your perception of pain.  
3. Position your body in the posture that feels most comfortable to you.  
4. Use religious beliefs, such as chanting or praying, to shift your focus away from pain.  
5. Ask your treating physician whether cold or hot compresses can help reduce pain.  
6. When pain becomes unbearable, inform medical staff and request adjustments to your analgesic medication.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1944_836_2282_1096.jpg" alt="Image" width="14%" /></div>

## IV. Common questions about pain:

1. Using analgesics does not affect wound healing; in fact, pain relief helps patients get out of bed earlier, which promotes wound healing.  
2. Side effects of analgesics: such as skin itching, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting can be improved by adjusting the dosage.  
3. Self-controlled analgesia: The goal is to use the minimal effective dose of medication so that patients do not feel pain while resting in bed. However, some pain may still be felt during intense coughing or movement, but the pain will be significantly reduced.4. Duration of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA): Pain will gradually decrease 2–3 days after surgery. Oral analgesics can then be used instead, and PCA can be discontinued.

5. Differences between patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and traditional analgesia:

(1) PCA delivers medication continuously through a machine; patients can press a button themselves when experiencing severe pain to reduce discomfort.

(2) Traditional analgesia is administered only when pain becomes unbearable; the medication starts working after 30 minutes and lasts for 4–6 hours.

6. The anesthesiologist will set the dosage and timing of PCA based on the patient's individual conditions. The dosage will be adjusted during the use period according to the patient's condition, so there is no risk of addiction or overdose.

7. The anesthesiologist will assess the patient's condition. If the patient shows signs of altered consciousness, low blood pressure, hypovolemia, or septic shock, PCA will not be administered.

8. Traditional analgesia is covered by the public health insurance; PCA is not covered and must be paid for out-of-pocket.

## Rehabilitation Exercises After Surgery

Following the rehabilitation exercises guided by a physical therapist can effectively improve functional recovery.

(1) The first 1–3 months after surgery is the period of maximum protection for the affected limb.

(2) Please follow the principle of using the healthy limb to go up the stairs and the affected limb to go down the stairs, with both feet stepping on the same step (mnemonic: "Good people use the healthy limb to go to heaven; bad people use the affected limb to go to hell").

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_76_405_1124_1048.jpg" alt="Image" width="44%" /></div>

<div style="text-align: center;">Diagram showing the wrapping of the limb for the surgical affected side</div>

## Seven. Walking Activities

1. On the first day after surgery: Encourage the patient to remain in a semi-sitting position (approximately 70°–90°) as much as possible to prevent postural hypotension when getting up from bed. Gradual mobilization should be adopted: first raise the bed, wait for 10 minutes without discomfort, then sit at the edge of the bed for 5–10 minutes. If no dizziness or discomfort occurs, assist the patient in standing with a walker under supervision. Only after confirming no dizziness during standing should the patient use a walker to walk within the ward.

2. From the second day after surgery onwards: The patient can walk with a walker on the hospital corridor, four times per day, each session lasting 5 minutes. After activity, the affected limb should be elevated and ice-cold compress applied to help reduce swelling.

3. The use of a walker should be maintained for at least 6–8 weeks to prevent excessive weight-bearing on the bone before it has fully healed.

## Eight. Wheelchair Transfers

Diagram showing the wrapping of the limb for the surgical affected side

1. When standing up or sitting down, the operated foot should extend forward, with the healthy leg behind.

2. When standing up, press down with both hands to lift the body upward, avoiding excessive forward leaning.

3. After standing, move both hands to the walker handles for support.

4. During transfers, ensure that the wheelchair or bed is within the range that can be reached when sitting.## 8. Preventing Falls

Falls can be prevented. With just a few simple changes, you can avoid falling into a fall-related crisis. Please note: **NEVER get out of bed alone!!**

## 9. Postoperative Care and Precautions

## 1. How to Prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)

Avoid prolonged sitting or standing. When lying in bed, avoid long-term pressure on the lower limbs. Do not maintain any posture for too long—such as crossing legs while standing, wearing tight clothing. Maintain a healthy body weight, drink adequate fluids, follow a low-fat diet, engage in appropriate physical activity, and avoid smoking.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1299_590_1776_948.jpg" alt="Image" width="20%" /></div>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1795_590_2281_948.jpg" alt="Image" width="20%" /></div>

If medical compression stockings are required after surgery, follow these principles:

1. Wear them for at least 3 days after surgery  
2. Put them on before getting out of bed in the morning, and remove them when bathing at night (recommended: wear for 8 hours per day, for one month)  
3. Hand-wash and lay flat to dry  
(Do not use a dryer or hang to dry in direct sunlight)

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1974_1120_2293_1658.jpg" alt="Image" width="13%" /></div>## 2. Wound Care After Returning Home

### 1. Wash hands before and after touching the wound.

2. Wound disinfection or cleaning should be performed from inside to outside, without back-and-forth wiping. The disinfection area should extend 5 cm beyond the wound margin. When changing the dressing, try to minimize the exposure of the wound to air.

3. Change the dressing once daily (it can be done after bathing). However, if the gauze becomes soaked with blood, gets accidentally wet, or falls off, the dressing must be changed immediately.

4. Keep the wound and gauze clean and dry. Avoid bathing the wound, and prefer using a wiping method instead.

5. Items needed for dressing change preparation:

(1) 20 ml normal saline solution: discard after single use

(2) 4×4 gauze

(3) sterile cotton swabs

(4) water-soluble povidone-iodine: shelf life is one week after opening.

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_607_676_1126_1204.jpg" alt="Image" width="21%" />
</div>

(5) 3M paper tape: if allergic to paper tape, choose a non-allergenic adhesive tape instead)

(6) 6-inch elastic bandage (can be washed and reused).

### 6. Wound care steps:

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1277_199_1759_508.jpg" alt="Image" width="20%" />

6. Follow the doctor's instructions for applying elastic bandages and wearing compression stockings.## Three. Precautions for Home Care

1. Continue performing rehabilitation exercises taught in the hospital every day after returning home.

2. Keep the wound as dry as possible. If redness, swelling, or abnormal exudate occurs, seek medical evaluation promptly.

3. Avoid friction or impact to the wound and intense physical activities (such as running or jumping). Adhere to the activity restrictions instructed by your doctor.

4. A walking aid must be used for 6 to 8 weeks post-surgery until your doctor, during follow-up visits, deems it safe to resume normal activities. Prevent falls during this period.

5. After prolonged periods of standing or getting up from bed, blood circulation in the affected limb may slow down, leading to swelling in the feet. Therefore, elevate the affected limb and apply ice to the wound after getting up to help reduce swelling.

6. The following activities must be approved by your doctor before being performed: driving, half-squatting, lifting heavy objects (over 3 kilograms), long-distance walking, or hiking.

7. When passing through security gates, the machine may alert you that you are carrying metal. You may explain the situation to the security officer or provide a hospital surgical certificate.

8. For internal or external metallic implants such as artificial joints, deep heat therapy (e.g., shortwave) is strictly prohibited, as excessive heat concentration may cause burns.

9. If you have a cold or infection in another area, or require dental treatment, inform your doctor about the presence of a prosthetic joint so that the doctor can appropriately adjust medication.

10. When can the wound be exposed to water? Only after your doctor has advised that the wound is safe to be exposed to water can you take a shower.

11. Seek immediate medical follow-up if any of the following occur:

(1) The wound has not healed after a long time, with persistent exudate, odor, or continuous bleeding.

(2) The wound shows redness, warmth around the skin, or severe pain that does not improve.

(3) A fever persists above 38.5°C.

## Precautions:

(1) After returning home, it is recommended to perform home rehabilitation exercises four times a day, each session lasting about 30 minutes.  

(2) For each exercise, maintain a duration of 5~15 seconds based on the recovery status of the surgical site.  

(3) After each exercise, apply ice for 10~15 minutes, and take prescribed medications as directed by your doctor to effectively control pain in the affected leg, which will lead to better rehabilitation outcomes.  

(4) If intense pain occurs during exercise, seek medical attention immediately and receive appropriate medical treatment.  

(5) For 6~8 weeks post-surgery, use a walker to walk, to prevent falls, until your doctor during outpatient follow-up deems it safe to resume normal activities.  

(6) Within three months post-surgery, when going up stairs, lead with the unaffected leg; when going down stairs, lead with the affected leg to protect the surgical site. Refer to page 26 of the health education booklet for reference.  

Going up and down stairs carries a risk of falling; it is recommended that family members accompany the patient.## Eleven. References
