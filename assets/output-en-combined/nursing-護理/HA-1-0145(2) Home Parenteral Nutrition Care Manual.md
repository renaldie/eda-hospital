## Introduction

Food and health are closely related. With modern people's diverse daily routines, nutritional imbalance often occurs, leading to various potential diseases. In recent years, medical science has advanced significantly, and diseases that were once considered incurable now have new treatments, cures, or ways to alleviate symptoms, extending patients' lifespans. However, as patients' conditions change during treatment, they may at certain stages be unable to obtain sufficient nutrition through the gastrointestinal tract. In such cases, they may need to rely on intravenous nutrition (commonly known as "nutrition injections" or "infusions") for long-term or temporary support—becoming essential for sustaining life.

To enable you and your family to receive safe infusion nutrition treatment at home, we provide relevant educational content to help you and your family carry out the care of various nutrition infusions at home. This allows for self-care at home while continuing to work, significantly improving your or your family's quality of life.## Table of Contents

Some patients, due to illness, are unable to absorb nutrients through their mouth or gastrointestinal tract. In such cases, nutrients can be delivered directly into large blood vessels near the heart via a tube. This prevents inflammation in smaller peripheral blood vessels.

## 【Who needs home-based enteral nutrition?】

Sometimes patients no longer need hospitalization but are still unable to obtain nutrients through their mouth or nasogastric tube. With the assistance of medical and nursing teams, they can receive nutritional infusions at home.## 【Three: What should be paid attention to when receiving nutritional infusion at home?】

(1) Select family members or patients to receive care training. Training items include:

1. How to change the catheter? What is the drip rate?

2. How to measure blood glucose.

3. Record the amount of infusion administered, food intake, bowel movements, urine output, and bring the records to the hospital for reference during weekly outpatient visits.

4. Monitor for redness, swelling, or leakage at the injection site; change the catheter daily.

5. Prevention and observation of complications: check for fever, redness, swelling, heat, pain at the injection site, sweating, dizziness, or discomfort.

6. How to collect medication and attend follow-up appointments.

7. Who to contact when problems arise?

(2) Prepare a refrigerator for storing the nutritional infusion and the necessary disinfection supplies.

(3) Before each infusion, wash hands thoroughly with soap or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

(4) Coordinate the infusion schedule with family members' availability. In hospitals, infusions typically run for 24 hours. However, if the patient has sufficient physical strength to move around, discuss with the medical team to adjust the infusion duration to 16–20 hours. This allows patients to engage in activities such as bathing or walking during the non-infusion periods.

(5) Take body temperature daily.

(6) Weigh the patient weekly during outpatient visits.

(7) During weekly outpatient visits, go to the chemotherapy room to change the injection needle or disinfect the injection site.The site.

(8) Pay attention at all times to the infusion condition of the nutritional infusion, to prevent blood glucose from being too low or too high.

(9) If you experience any problems or symptoms, such as fever, high (or low) blood glucose, or other issues, please contact the parenteral nutrition nurse.

(10) Pay attention to outpatient appointment times; if you are unable to go to the hospital, please contact the parenteral nutrition nurse.

(11) Although food intake is small, oral hygiene should still be maintained.

## 【Four. Storage Methods for Parenteral Nutrition Infusions】

1. Total parenteral nutrition: Store in the refrigerator (2-8°C), as shown in Figure 2.

2. Peripheral parenteral nutrition: Store at 15-25°C in a cool, shaded area indoors, away from sunlight.

3. Lipid emulsions: Store at 15-25°C in a cool, shaded area indoors, away from sunlight.

## [11. Outpatient Schedule]

### 1. Collecting Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN)

Visit the outpatient clinic of the nutrition specialist physician every week for blood tests. The physician and specialized venous nurse will assess the home use of parenteral nutrition. The physician will decide, based on the situation, whether to schedule follow-up visits at regular intervals.Between the time of prescription issuance, go to the pricing counter to settle the bill. Approximately 2–3 hours later, please go to the pharmacy on the first floor to collect the lipid emulsion and the medication consultation room to collect the total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solution. Also, collect the related medical supplies at the first-floor injection room (light-protected tubing, regular tubing, three-way piston, 5 cc syringe caps, and 10 cc syringe caps). During the journey home, the total parenteral nutrition solution must be kept cold using an ice bucket. Once home, store it in the refrigerator, where it can be kept for up to 7 days.

### 2. Collection of Peripheral Parenteral Nutrition

Visit your original treating physician's outpatient clinic for a follow-up visit. The physician and the specialized peripheral venous nutrition nurse will assess your home-based peripheral venous nutrition usage. The physician will determine the frequency of outpatient follow-ups based on the situation and issue a prescription. After receiving the prescription, go to the pricing counter to settle the bill. Collect the peripheral parenteral nutrition solution at the pharmacy on the first floor. Also, collect the required medical supplies (regular tubing, syringe caps, and 10 cc syringe caps) at the first-floor injection room. After returning home, store the solution at room temperature and avoid exposure to direct sunlight.

## [12. Daily Living Care]

## (1) Bathing:

Bathing can be done during times when no parenteral nutrition injections are being administered. If it is unavoidable and the injection site gets wet, there is no need to worry, as the sterile transparent dressing (OP SITE) is waterproof. If water does enter the injection site, simply re-disinfect and change the dressing.

## (2) Activities:

Try to administer injections at night, allowing daytime activities such as going out or attending school. Older children can be trained to take on some responsibility for their care. Family members should treat the situation with normalcy and avoid excessive concern.Protect him.

## (3) Diet:

For patients receiving central venous nutrition therapy, it is almost impossible to absorb nutrients through the mouth or gastrointestinal tract. When a patient's condition improves, doctors will assess whether oral feeding is possible. Since each patient has different physical conditions, do not encourage patients to try oral intake without first discussing with medical staff.

(4) Urination and defecation:

Central venous nutrition therapy may lead to frequent nighttime urination, which can affect sleep. In such cases, discuss with your doctor to adjust the timing of nutrient infusion. Additionally, consider whether the locations for urination and defecation are convenient. If physical strength decreases, consider renting or purchasing a commode chair to prevent falls.

(5) Clothing:

Choose loose, button-up clothing, and secure the infusion set with tape to avoid pulling on the catheter when changing clothes.

(6) Living environment:

If you do not have a portable infusion stand, you can install hooks at home that can support the IV bags.Da Yang Medical Foundation
