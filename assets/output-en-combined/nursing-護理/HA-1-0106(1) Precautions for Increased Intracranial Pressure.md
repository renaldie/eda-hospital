## Four. Symptoms of Increased Intracranial Pressure

Early symptoms of increased intracranial pressure may include: headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, restlessness, elevated blood pressure, elevated body temperature, dilated pupils, seizures, and changes in consciousness.

## Five. Precautions

(1) Closely monitor the condition of increased intracranial pressure.

(2) During hospitalization, rest in bed and elevate the head by approximately 30–40 degrees.

(3) Maintain a straight head and neck position; avoid pressure or twisting to prevent affecting cerebral blood circulation.

(4) Eat more high-fiber foods (such as vegetables and fruits) to prevent constipation.

(5) Maintain normal bowel function; avoid straining during defecation or blowing the nose, as this may lead to increased intracranial pressure.

(6) Maintain a calm environment and minimize environmental stimuli.

## Precautions for Increased Intracranial Pressure

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_685_343_1130_802.jpg" alt="Image" width="37%" /></div>## Caution for Increased Intracranial Pressure

## I. Purpose

To prevent neurosurgical patients from experiencing increased intracranial pressure due to intracranial diseases, and to educate patients on how to observe and prevent increased intracranial pressure after discharge. This enables early detection of problems, control of brain pressure, and prevention of complications.

## II. Causes of Increased Intracranial Pressure

(1) Intracranial diseases: intracranial hemorrhage, hematoma, tumor.

(2) Cerebral edema: intracranial hemorrhage and hematoma caused by head trauma; malignant brain tumors; cerebrovascular diseases; after craniotomy.

(3) Improper cerebrospinal fluid drainage: congenital obstruction of the cerebral aqueduct, compression of the ventricles, reduced rate of cerebrospinal fluid absorption, excessive cerebrospinal fluid secretion.

(4) Bacterial or viral infections: encephalitis, meningitis, brain abscess.

## III. Factors that May Trigger Increased Intracranial Pressure

* Increased intrathoracic pressure: e.g., coughing

$ ^{*} $ Increased intra-abdominal pressure: e.g., straining during defecation

* Changes in posture: e.g., higher intracranial pressure when lying flat, improper head positioning affecting cerebral blood flow

$ ^{*} $ Environmental stimuli: e.g., bright light, loud noise, which may trigger increased intracranial pressure.
