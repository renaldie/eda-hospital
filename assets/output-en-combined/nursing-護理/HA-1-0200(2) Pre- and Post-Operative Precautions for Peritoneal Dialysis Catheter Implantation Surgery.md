## Pre- and Post-Operative Care for Peritoneal Dialysis Catheter Placement

## 1. What is Peritoneal Dialysis?

Peritoneal dialysis is a method of treating patients using the peritoneum, a membrane in the abdominal cavity. During surgery, a peritoneal dialysis catheter is implanted into the abdominal cavity through the abdominal wall. This catheter allows dialysis fluid to be infused into the peritoneal cavity. During the dwell period, waste products in the blood pass through the tiny blood vessels of the peritoneum into the dialysis fluid. After a regular interval, the dialysis fluid, now containing waste products, is drained from the abdominal cavity and replaced with a fresh bag of dialysis fluid. This process is repeated daily as prescribed, effectively removing metabolic waste products generated by the body.

Pre-treatment preparation: Before surgery, the patient will undergo preoperative evaluation and explanation by the surgical catheter placement physician, and also receive preoperative assessment and health education from an anesthesiologist. The physician will implant the peritoneal dialysis catheter using either laparoscopic or traditional surgical techniques.

## 2. Why is Catheter Placement Necessary?

When kidney function deteriorates (whether acute or chronic), the kidneys are no longer able to remove metabolic waste products from the blood—such as urea nitrogen and creatinine, which are toxic substances produced during protein metabolism—and excess fluid that would normally be excreted as urine. This condition is known as uremia. Peritoneal dialysis involves infusing specially designed dialysis fluid into the abdominal cavity via a catheter. The dialysis fluid remains in the abdominal cavity for a period of time, during which toxic substances and excess fluid in the blood pass through the microvessels of the peritoneum into the dialysis fluid. The fluid is then drained out through the catheter and replaced with fresh dialysis fluid. This process effectively replaces the function of the kidneys, reducing discomfort caused by the accumulation of toxins and excess fluid in the body, such as confusion, generalized edema, or pulmonary edema.## Three. Pipeline Care and Precautions

## (1) Before Surgery

1. If you have constipation or have not had a bowel movement daily, please inform your doctor for evaluation.

Purpose: To reduce the risk of pipeline obstruction after catheter placement.

2. Prepare an abdominal binder (for abdominal surgery):

To be brought into the operating room with the patient on the day of surgery, for ease of use postoperatively.

Timing of binder use: From the day of surgery until 2 weeks postoperatively. The binder may be temporarily omitted if the patient is lying flat and not turning or moving.

## (2) After Surgery

1. The pipeline is enclosed within the abdominal binder.

2. Check the wound dressing for any signs of bleeding.

3. Disinfect the wound daily.

Within 24 hours after surgery: Encourage bed rest to reduce pulling on the wound, which may cause pain and bleeding.

After 24 hours post-surgery: When the patient's condition allows, get out of bed and move around to promote intestinal peristalsis.
