# Respiratory Movement Before and After Surgery  

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_656_247_1129_758.jpg" alt="Image" width="39%" /></div>## Respiratory Exercises Before and After Surgery

## I. Introduction:

1. Expand lung capacity and promote recovery of lung function.

2. Reduce the incidence of complications and facilitate early recovery.

## II. Methods:

1. Maintain proper body position

(1) Raise the head of the bed by approximately 30–45 degrees.

(2) Raise the foot of the bed to prevent the buttocks from sliding down; this also helps relax abdominal muscles, facilitating deep breathing and coughing. Additionally, a pillow can be placed under the knees for support.

2. Diaphragmatic deep breathing

(1) Place hands on the lower edge of the sternum or on the navel.

(2) Slightly purse the lips and slowly exhale through the mouth.

(3) Inhale slowly through the nose while expanding the abdomen.

(4) Continue inhaling until fully saturated, then hold the breath for 3 seconds, and slowly exhale through the mouth.

(5) Patients can begin performing 8–10 diaphragmatic deep breaths per hour once they have regained consciousness after anesthesia.

3. Use of deep breathing device (lung expansion ball)

(1) Adopt a semi-recumbent or sitting position.

(2) Hold one hand steady on the tube, and use the other hand to grip the device vertically.

(3) Slightly purse the lips and slowly exhale through the mouth.

(4) Immediately after exhaling, place the mouthpiece into the mouth and inhale steadily and smoothly until the device reaches its highest point.

(5) After fully inhaling, hold the breath for 3 seconds, then slowly exhale through the nose.

### 4. Coughing and wound stabilization

(1) Use a small pillow or folded towel to form a small square pad, or press the wound with both hands to prevent pulling on the wound during coughing, thus avoiding pain.

(2) Inhale slowly until fully saturated, pause briefly, open the mouth, and forcefully and quickly expel phlegm.

### 5. Nebulizer therapy

(1) Adopt a semi-recumbent or sitting position.

(2) Place the mouthpiece in the mouth, breathe calmly, and intermittently perform deep breaths.

(3) Continue treatment until the medication is fully administered.

(4) When phlegm is present during or after treatment, expel the phlegm by coughing.

### 6. Thoracic movement and limb exercises

(1) Adopt a semi-recumbent or sitting position.

(2) Extend arms sideways, then raise them upward. Inhale slowly during the upward movement, hold the breath at the highest point, then slowly lower the arms and exhale.

(3) Initially, perform alternating single-arm raises; once physical strength has recovered, perform simultaneous arm raises.

(4) As soon as possible, get out of bed and begin physical activity.
