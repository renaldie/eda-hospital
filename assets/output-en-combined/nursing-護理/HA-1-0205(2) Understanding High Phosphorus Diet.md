## Understanding High Phosphorus Diet

## 1. Blood Phosphorus Treatment Goals

Blood phosphorus levels should be controlled between 3.5 to 5.5 mg/dl.

## 2. Causes of High Blood Phosphorus

(1) Poor dietary control, resulting in excessive intake of high-phosphorus foods.

(2) Inadequate or irregular use of phosphate-lowering medications.

(3) Elevated parathyroid hormone levels.

(4) Insufficient dialysis volume or lack of regular dialysis.

(5) Use of vitamin D3 therapy.

## 3. Symptoms of High Blood Phosphorus

(1) Skin itching.

(2) Tissue calcification, cardiovascular calcification, leading to cardiovascular diseases.

(3) Bone loss, fractures, and renal bone disease.

(4) Elevated parathyroid hormone levels.

(5) Increased mortality rate.

## 4. Treatment for High Blood Phosphorus

(1) Avoid high-phosphorus foods, such as:

1. Meat: offal, egg yolks, ham, sausages, meatballs, ramen, etc.

2. Nuts: peanuts, sunflower seeds, walnuts, cashews, chocolate, etc.

3. Grains: brown rice, whole grain rice, whole wheat bread, cereal, rice milk, etc.## EDX Jewish Chief Financial Officer E-DA HEALTHCARE GROUP

4. Dairy products: milk, cheese, cakes, etc.

5. Broths: meat broth, chicken broth, bone broth, hot pot broth, etc.

6. Beverages: hand-held cups, carbonated drinks, yogurt, three-in-one coffee, alcoholic beverages, etc.

7. Others: instant noodles, canned foods, snacks, etc.

(二) Take phosphate-binding medications correctly. Grind the phosphate binders into a fine powder and mix them evenly into food during meals. Do not skip any meal. For example, calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, and the self-paid Fosrenol should be taken with meals to achieve effective blood phosphate reduction. Calcium acetate must be taken with meals to achieve its phosphate-lowering effect.

(三) Take phosphate binders on time, without skipping any meal, including snacks and meals outside the home. Carry the medication when dining out.

(四) Prolonged elevated blood phosphate levels may lead to adverse effects such as skin itching, bone changes, or excessive calcium-phosphate product leading to calcification outside the bones and vascular calcification in various organs.

(五) Regular and adequate dialysis is crucial for removing phosphate from the blood. If necessary, increase the dialysate volume as prescribed by a doctor.

(六) Temporarily discontinue the use of vitamin D3.
