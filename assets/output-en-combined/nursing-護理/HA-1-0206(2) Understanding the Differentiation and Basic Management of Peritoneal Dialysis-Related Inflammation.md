# Recognizing and Basic Management of Inflammation Related to Peritoneal Dialysis (Peritonitis, Inflammation at the Catheter Exit Site, Tunnel Inflammation)

## I. Peritonitis

**(1) Symptoms:**

1. Cloudy dialysate.

2. Abdominal pain.

3. Fever, chills.

4. Gastrointestinal symptoms: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation.

5. Fibrous material in the drainage fluid.

6. Worsening of peritoneal dialysis dehydration.

7. Difficulty with catheter drainage.

**(2) Basic Management:**

1. When cloudy dialysate is observed, peritonitis may have occurred.

2. Immediately contact the peritoneal dialysis nurse to report the situation and proposed management, and go to the hospital for examination and treatment.

3. If cloudy drainage fluid is noticed after 17:00 on weekdays or on weekends and holidays, bring with you the usual dialysate solution, mask, scale, hand tissue, and 75% alcohol for emergency department visit.

4. Before coming to the hospital, confirm that dialysate has been infused into the abdomen; after 2 hours, the fluid can be drained to check for bacterial infection. Upon arrival at the hospital, the abdominal dialysate will be drained and handed over to the nurse for testing.

5. After the dialysate test results are available, if the bacterial count exceeds the standard value, peritonitis is confirmed, and the physician will prescribe antibiotics.

6. If there is no fever or severe abdominal pain, and after consultation and approval by the nephrology physician, antibiotics can be self-administered at home by adding them directly into the dialysate bag. After receiving instruction from the peritoneal dialysis nurse on how to add antibiotics to the dialysate bag, patients can return home to self-administer the medication.

7. Important note: If the drainage fluid remains cloudy after 3 days at home, or if abdominal pain or edema occurs, contact the peritoneal dialysis unit immediately.

## II. Inflammation at the Catheter Exit Site:

**(1) Abnormal catheter exit site:** If any of the following conditions occur, contact the peritoneal dialysis nurse immediately.

1. Redness, swelling, heat, pain, or discharge at the wound site.

2. The button (sleeve) slipping off and protruding at the exit site.

3. The hair-covered sleeve button slipping off, exposing the wound.

4. The wound showing granulation tissue, or an unstable wound.5. There are large areas of crust at the catheter exit.

## (二) Prevention of catheter exit infection:

1. Maintain personal and environmental hygiene, and change clean clothes daily.

2. Develop the habit of bathing daily to maintain body cleanliness. During bathing, wear disposable ostomy bags to prevent bathwater from contaminating the catheter exit. After bathing, promptly perform catheter exit care to keep the area dry.

3. Avoid soaking baths or warm baths (e.g., hot tubs), as these increase the risk of infection at the catheter exit.

4. For newly placed catheters, do not bathe until the exit has fully healed. During the first month, you may use a damp towel to wipe the upper body and rinse the lower body with clean water to avoid wetting the catheter exit, which could lead to more severe infections.

5. If the catheter exit becomes wet or soiled, change the dressing immediately to keep the exit dry and clean—especially during hot, humid weather when sweating is common.

6. When performing catheter exit care, do not use fans. Be cautious to avoid wind or dust contaminating the catheter exit.

7. If there is redness, swelling, heat, pain, discharge, or granulation tissue at the catheter exit, contact the peritoneal dialysis room for examination and treatment by a physician or nurse, and increase dressing changes accordingly.

8. Do not apply any ointments, petroleum jelly, creams, or powders to the catheter exit without medical advice.

9. Avoid pulling on the catheter. Do not tighten the waistband over the exit, and avoid friction or scratching the catheter exit. You may discuss with your doctor whether to use anti-itch ointment to relieve itching.

10. Use a secure dressing to fix the catheter and protect it.

11. Never use scissors or small knives to cut gauze, tape, ostomy bags, or other items near the catheter, as this may accidentally cut or puncture the catheter.

12. During monthly blood draws, please visit the peritoneal dialysis room for a nurse to inspect the catheter exit.

## Three: Infection of the catheter tunnel:

(一) Abnormal pressure at the tunnel site:

Gently press the catheter tunnel from the scar site to the catheter exit with your finger, checking for signs of redness, swelling, heat, pain, or discharge. If any of these are present, contact the peritoneal dialysis nursing staff immediately for evaluation and management.

(二) Prevention of catheter tunnel infection: Same as prevention of catheter exit infection.
