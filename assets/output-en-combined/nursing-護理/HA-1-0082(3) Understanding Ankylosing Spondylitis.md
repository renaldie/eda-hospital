Understanding Ankylosing Spondylitis

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_668_257_1118_777.jpg" alt="Image" width="37%" /></div>## One: What is Ankylosing Spondylitis?

Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the spine, primarily presenting with lower back pain. It commonly affects young males aged 20–40 years, although females can also develop it—though cases are less common and symptoms tend to be milder.

## Two: Symptoms of Ankylosing Spondylitis:

1. Chronic lower back pain.  
2. Morning stiffness in the neck, especially upon waking; symptoms improve after activity.  
3. Restricted range of motion.  
4. In addition to joint inflammation, it may also affect other parts of the body, particularly the eyes (causing uveitis) or the kidneys (leading to renal complications).

## Three: Treatment of Ankylosing Spondylitis:

1. Medication:

(1) Anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving drugs (NSAIDs):  
Aim to reduce pain, enable patients to engage in more physical activity, and improve quality of life. However, they do not alter the disease course.

(2) Take medication as prescribed by a doctor. The most commonly used drug is "Sulfasalazine," which has immunomodulatory properties and can modify disease activity.

(3) Biologic agents: Also known as targeted therapy, these drugs remove inflammatory mediators (such as tumor necrosis factor) or cytokines related to disease mechanisms. They can suppress joint inflammation, control pain, and slow joint damage. These medications require prior approval from the national health insurance system before use.

2. Surgery:  
For patients with severe spinal deformity, surgery may be performed to improve joint function. Patients with severely damaged hip joints may undergo joint repair or joint replacement surgery.

## Four: Home Care Precautions:

1. Exercise:

(1) Maintaining spinal mobility and improving quality of life is crucial—activities such as yoga, swimming, and dancing are recommended.  
(2) Proper posture is important; avoid staying in the same position for long periods.  
(3) Avoid lifting heavy objects or carrying heavy loads to prevent increased lumbar strain and back pain. Instead, perform spinal stretching exercises to prevent spinal deformity.

2. Dietary principles: Avoid obesity, as excess weight increases the burden on the waist and joints.

(1) Regular eye examinations: Approximately 20% of patients may develop iritis or uveitis.  
(2) Regular follow-up visits to a rheumatology or immunology outpatient clinic for ongoing treatment and monitoring.
