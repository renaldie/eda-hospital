Can reduce the risk of transmission without requiring separate rooms.

9. Regular X-ray examinations.

10. Scheduled outpatient follow-ups.

【Family Members Should Be Aware】

1. If someone in the household has tuberculosis, close contacts should also undergo X-ray examinations.

2. When caring for a patient with open pulmonary tuberculosis, wear a mask and wash hands regularly.

3. Anti-tuberculosis medication effectively controls tuberculosis transmission. If the patient takes the medication as prescribed for more than two weeks, the risk of transmission can be significantly reduced.

4. Assist in reminding the patient to take medication and attend follow-up appointments.

## Understanding Tuberculosis and Precautions

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_671_409_1124_781.jpg" alt="Image" width="38%" /></div>## Understanding Tuberculosis and Precautions

## 1. What is Tuberculosis?

Tuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis invading the human body, primarily spreading through airborne droplets (airborne transmission). Any organ in the human body can be infected, such as the lungs, meninges, intestines, reproductive organs, bones, and lymph nodes. However, the lungs are the most commonly affected, accounting for about 90% of cases.

The main mode of infection is inhaling Mycobacterium tuberculosis from the droplets of a tuberculosis patient. It is not hereditary.

Tuberculosis can be classified into two types: open (accounting for 1/10 of cases) and non-open (accounting for 9/10 of cases). An open tuberculosis patient has a high number of bacteria in their sputum and is highly contagious. A non-open tuberculosis patient has fewer bacteria in their sputum and is less contagious.

## 2. Transmission Method:

Tuberculosis is an airborne disease. When a contagious tuberculosis patient coughs, sneezes, or speaks loudly, they release tuberculosis bacteria into the air, which can then infect others.

Tuberculosis bacteria are not transmitted through food. Therefore, in principle, tuberculosis patients can eat meals with their family members without needing to eat separately.

## 3. Possible Symptoms:

1. Early tuberculosis patients may show no obvious symptoms.

2. Persistent coughing and expectoration of sputum.

3. Feeling tired and having a poor appetite.

4. Unexplained weight loss.

5. Possible afternoon fever and night sweats.

6. Chest pain or coughing up blood.

## 4. Treatment:

1. Open tuberculosis patients can become less contagious and turn into non-open patients after two weeks of regular treatment and medication as prescribed. However, non-open patients who do not receive treatment or receive improper treatment may develop into open cases, becoming highly contagious and capable of spreading the disease to others.

2. Current tuberculosis treatment primarily involves anti-tuberculosis drugs. Adhering to the prescribed medication regimen can fully cure the disease. Standard treatment usually lasts at least six months, with some cases requiring treatment for nine to twelve months or longer. Therefore, patients should remain committed and take medication as instructed by medical staff. They should not stop taking medication simply because symptoms have disappeared or improved. Doing so may lead to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis or chronic open tuberculosis, which are difficult or even untreatable conditions.

## 5. Testing:

1. Chest X-ray examination can help detect abnormal lesions early.

2. Sputum testing: sputum is examined through smear and culture.

3. Tuberculin skin test: a positive result indicates past infection or a strong reaction to the BCG vaccine.

## 6. Precautions:

【Patients should note】

1. Take medication as prescribed by the doctor. If any discomfort occurs, inform your doctor immediately. Do not stop taking medication or use unverified traditional remedies on your own.

2. Maintain a balanced diet.

3. Smokers should quit smoking.

4. Ensure good indoor air circulation and adequate lighting.

5. Develop good hygiene habits. When coughing or sneezing, use tissue paper to cover and dispose of sputum in a sealed trash bag.

6. When coughing or sneezing, cover the mouth and nose or wear a mask.

7. Engage in moderate physical activity and rest. Avoid staying up late.

8. For patients with spouses, as long as they receive proper treatment and take medication on time,
