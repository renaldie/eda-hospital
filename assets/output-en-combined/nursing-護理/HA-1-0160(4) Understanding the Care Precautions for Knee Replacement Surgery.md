</div>## III. Understanding Total Knee Arthroplasty

## I. Introduction

When the knee joint degenerates, it can cause pain, swelling, deformity, and weakness in the affected limb. In severe cases, this may lead to difficulty walking. Initial outpatient management typically involves medication and physical therapy. If these treatments fail to relieve pain or deformity and result in difficulty walking, total knee arthroplasty may be required.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_952_1418_1157_1619.jpg" alt="Image" width="17%" /></div>## Three. What is Total Knee Arthroplasty?

A surgical procedure involving the implantation of artificial joints into the tibia and femur due to damage or pathology of the knee joint. The artificial knee joint is made from metal and high-density plastic materials, designed according to the anatomical structure, shape, and function of the human knee joint. The surgeon removes the worn-out cartilage and implants artificial joints into the tibia and femur to replace them.

## 1. Preparation of Equipment

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_88_242_442_475.jpg" alt="Image" width="29%" /></div>

## (1) Walker

Starting from postoperative day 1–2, medical and nursing staff will teach patients how to use assistive devices to get out of bed and move around.

(2) Ice pack  
Used for icing the surgical wound postoperatively to prevent swelling of the affected limb and alleviate pain.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_809_502_1183_748.jpg" alt="Image" width="31%" /></div>

## (3) Personal Medications

Please bring your regularly taken medications, along with the medication bottles and packaging, to the hospital on the day of admission and hand them over to the nursing staff so that medical and nursing personnel can understand your medication regimen. (If you are taking anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, or vasodilators, please continue taking them as prescribed by your doctor and inform the medical and nursing staff.)

(4) Medical Grade Grade 1 Ankle Elastic Compression Socks  
Worn postoperatively to prevent deep vein thrombosis in the lower limbs.

(5) Signed Consent Forms

✓ Surgical Consent Form  
✓ Anesthesia Consent Form  
✓ Pre-anesthesia Assessment Form  
✓ Self-pay Consent Form

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_600_1245_1122_1495.jpg" alt="Image" width="43%" /></div>## II. Should anticoagulant medications be stopped before surgery?

Which anticoagulant medications should be temporarily discontinued before joint replacement surgery? For how long should they be stopped?

Many elderly patients with joint degeneration also have cardiovascular diseases and are currently taking antithrombotic medications. These drugs provide cardiovascular protection and help prevent tragic events such as heart attacks and strokes. The decision to stop or continue these medications hinges on balancing the benefits against the risks.

"Before undergoing any surgery, please inform your doctor about the medications you are currently taking."

Please proactively discuss this with your doctor and do not make decisions about medication use on your own.

## Antithrombotic Medications

## Antiplatelet Medications

• Aspirin  
· Aspirin (Lixi)  
• Baotu Tong / Jianke Tan  
· Puda / Jianlidai  
· Nankangping  

Anticoagulants  
• Kemaiting / Oufuning  
- Novel anticoagulants (Puxuanda, Bairui, Aibikening, Lixinan)## Three. Preoperative Instructions

1. Blood tests, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, and pre-anesthesia evaluation will be completed on the day of admission.

2. To prevent aspiration pneumonia during surgery due to vomiting, patients must fast for 8 hours before surgery. Medical staff will inform patients of the fasting time after 9 p.m. Fasting items include: food, water, and any chewable items such as chewing gum or betel nut.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_921_600_1181_727.jpg" alt="Image" width="21%" /></div>

3. On the day before or on the day of surgery, patients are advised to bathe their affected limb and body.

4. Before surgery, the surgeon will mark the surgical site. Before entering the operating room, medical staff will perform local cleaning of the surgical site and cover it with a dressing.

5. The surgery duration is approximately 4 to 6 hours, depending on individual anesthesia methods and anesthesia recovery time. For patients undergoing general anesthesia, a breathing tube will be placed in the throat during anesthesia to assist with breathing, which may cause throat discomfort or slight blood-tinged sputum. Drinking small amounts of warm water frequently can help alleviate these symptoms. However, if fresh blood is continuously coughed up, patients should immediately inform medical staff for assistance.

6. A family member must accompany the patient throughout the entire surgical procedure and during the transfer back to the ward after surgery.## IV. Preoperative Rehabilitation Exercise Preparation

Exercise timing: Before surgery

Exercise objectives: Maintain joint flexion angle/increase muscle strength to facilitate smooth postoperative recovery

Exercise frequency: Hold each movement for 5 seconds, repeat 15 times per set, perform 4 sets per day.

Training purpose: Enhance muscle strength on the affected side; it is recommended to perform exercises bilaterally, with the affected limb indicated by the tape-wrapping illustration shown below.

Lying position: Raise the legs upward

Physical therapist's warm tip: Be cautious about safety and prevent falls

Produced by the Rehabilitation Department, Physical Therapy Team, Tainan Medical Foundation## VI. Post-surgical care guidelines

## 1. Postoperative limb positioning and care instructions

1. After surgery, to prevent swelling of the affected limb, pain, and peripheral circulation disorders, nursing staff will assist the patient in elevating the affected limb using a pillow or cotton blanket and applying ice packs.

2. Do not use supports or pillows under the knee of the affected limb, as this may cause knee contracture and prevent the leg from straightening properly.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_798_271_1190_493.jpg" alt="Image" width="32%" /></div>

3. Frequently change the position of ice application on the affected knee to avoid icing the knee joint or icing both knees simultaneously, which could lead to circulatory disorders. Ice application should be stopped after the patient goes to sleep at night.

4. To prevent fever and inadequate lung expansion, patients should perform deep breathing and coughing exercises regularly. Nursing staff will assist in teaching the patient to turn over and pat the back every two hours (avoiding the waist and spine). Patients are encouraged to increase fluid intake to 2000–3000 ml per day (except for patients with fluid restrictions).

5. Raise the head of the bed by approximately 30 to 45 degrees to facilitate eating and prevent vomiting-induced aspiration.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_632_1427_799_1593.jpg" alt="Image" width="14%" /></div>

Deep breathing and coughing techniques, as well as turning and back patting methods## II. Notes on Pipeline Placement

## (1) Indwelling Catheter

1. Due to postoperative activity safety, an indwelling catheter will be placed after surgery.

2. Medical staff will assess the appropriate time for removing the indwelling catheter.

3. The indwelling catheter will be secured on the inner thigh (for females) or lower abdomen (for males).

4. The urine collection bag should be placed below the bladder level; if placed above the bladder, urine backflow may occur, leading to infection. The bottom of the urine bag should be at least 3 cm above the ground to avoid contact with the floor.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_354_736_1035_1144.jpg" alt="Image" width="57%" /></div>

## At least 3 cm above the ground

5. If there is a persistent decrease in urine output or bladder pain, please check whether the catheter has kinked, and seek assistance from medical staff.## (二) Drainage Tube

1. After surgery, a drainage tube will be placed at the surgical site of the affected limb to drain blood and prevent hematoma.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_808_9_1155_311.jpg" alt="Image" width="29%" /></div>

2. During the placement of the drainage tube, in addition to preventing dislodgement of the tube, the Y-shaped connector should be frequently squeezed. Ice packs should not be applied directly to the drainage tube to avoid clot formation and obstruction.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_765_531_1184_773.jpg" alt="Image" width="35%" /></div>

3. You should turn frequently or get out of bed to promote drainage of blood. If the drainage tube rapidly swells, it may indicate excessive blood volume or a leak in the tubing; please inform the medical or nursing staff immediately for evaluation.

4. Since the drainage tube operates under negative pressure, it can be placed directly on the bed and does not need to be hung at the bedside. However, it should be avoided from being folded. When getting out of bed, it can be secured to clothing to prevent pulling or dislodgement of the tube.

5. The time for removal of the drainage tube varies depending on individual drainage volume. If removal is required, a physician will work with a specialist nurse to assist in the procedure.## Three. Dietary Guidance

1. After returning to the ward post-surgery, if there are no symptoms of dizziness or vomiting, adopt a progressive dietary approach: first try drinking a small amount of plain water. If no vomiting occurs, after one hour, consume liquid foods (such as fruit juice), then gradually progress to soft and easily digestible foods (such as porridge), and by the next day, normal diet can be resumed. This progressive diet helps prevent digestive discomfort caused by slow intestinal peristalsis due to anesthesia.

2. Eat more vitamin C-rich fruits such as kiwi, cherries, and grapes, as well as high-protein foods such as chicken, duck, fish, and beef, to promote wound healing. Also, consume high-fiber foods such as green vegetables to prevent constipation.

3. Remember to eat in a semi-reclining or sitting position, as eating while lying down increases the risk of aspiration and subsequent aspiration pneumonia.

Compiled by the Nutrition Therapy Department, Taitung Medical Foundation## IV. Postoperative Medications

## (I) Prophylactic Antibiotics

1. Surgical prophylactic antibiotics refer to the administration of antibiotics to patients before surgery, prior to wound contamination or infection, in order to prevent postoperative infections.

2. Possible side effects such as allergies or gastrointestinal discomfort—such as skin rash, itching, or diarrhea—should be reported immediately to the medical team if they occur.

## (II) Antithrombotic Medications

1. To prevent the occurrence of deep vein thrombosis, the physician will assess the patient's condition and decide whether to prescribe antithrombotic medications (such as antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants).

2. If you have a history of gastrointestinal bleeding or peptic ulcers, please inform the medical team in advance.

3. During medication, if you are undergoing any surgical procedures, tooth extraction, endoscopy, or other procedures or examinations that may cause bleeding, please inform your doctor in advance that you are taking these medications.

4. While taking antithrombotic medications, be cautious during daily activities to avoid injury. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush or an electric razor when brushing teeth or shaving.5. Possible side effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort or bleeding reactions (e.g., hematoma at the surgical site, gingival bleeding, bruising, hematuria, or black stools). If you experience any bleeding, please return to your medical team immediately.

6. If you were previously receiving antithrombotic medication before undergoing knee replacement surgery, and have already discontinued the medication prior to surgery after discussion with your original prescribing physician, please discuss with your surgical physician the timing for resuming antithrombotic medication after surgery.## VII. Pain Care

## 1. The Impact of Pain

Pain is a subjective sensation of suffering, which may be continuous or intermittent, and may manifest as dull, sharp, or stabbing pain. Physiologically, patients may experience anxiety, insomnia, reduced appetite, tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and endocrine dysfunction. Pain may also slow down breathing (pain from upper abdominal or thoracic surgery worsens with respiration), lead to unwillingness to get out of bed and move, resulting in inadequate lung expansion, venous thrombosis, and other complications, thereby delaying discharge.

Only you can describe your pain. Be brave and tell your doctor or nurse about your pain concerns. With correct expression and assessment methods, 90% of pain can be effectively relieved.

## What You Can Do:

1. You can describe where the pain is located, or use your hand to point out the painful area.

2. Inform medical and nursing staff when the pain first started, how often it occurs, and how long each episode lasts.

3. Clearly describe the sensation of the pain, such as dull, stabbing, or sharp pain?

4. Inform medical staff whether the pain has affected your daily routine, such as inability to sleep.

5. Accurately express your pain score.  
We recommend using the "Pain Assessment Scale"

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_642_1418_1190_1647.jpg" alt="Image" width="46%" /></div>To express pain level: 0 points means no pain, 10 points means unbearable pain.

## Two: Common postoperative pain relief methods

## Refuse postoperative pain—be brave and say "I'm in pain"

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_68_475_244_723.jpg" alt="Image" width="14%" /></div>

## Common postoperative pain relief methods include the following:

Oral medication: For mild pain, take medication as instructed by the doctor. Even if there is no current pain sensation, medication should still be taken to achieve better pain control.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_0_789_330_1103.jpg" alt="Image" width="27%" /></div>

## Intramuscular or intravenous injection (non-steroidal or morphine-based analgesics):

Each person has different pain tolerance and absorption efficiency, with time limitations. These methods require administration at fixed intervals as instructed by the doctor, or for sudden, acute pain requiring immediate relief.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1_1147_317_1422.jpg" alt="Image" width="26%" /></div>

Multimodal analgesia: Evaluated and prescribed by an anesthesiologist, this method selects the appropriate drug and route of administration. It uses machines or intravenous/local delivery, sets safe dosages and lock-in times, and allows patients to choose their preferred treatment.## Three. Methods to Alleviate Pain Other Than Medication Treatment

1. Distract yourself from pain through activities such as listening to music, playing cards, playing Mahjong, or walking.

2. Relax your mind and maintain a positive mood, for example, by receiving psychological support from family or friends, which can help reduce your perception of pain.

3. Position your body in the posture that feels most comfortable to you during daily life.

4. Use religious beliefs, such as chanting or praying, to divert attention from pain.

5. Ask your treating physician whether cold or hot compresses can help alleviate your pain.

6. When pain becomes unbearable, you can still inform medical staff and request adjustments to your pain medication.

## Four. Common Questions About Pain:

1. Using pain medication does not affect wound healing; rather, it helps by relieving pain, enabling you to get out of bed earlier and thus promoting wound healing.

2. Side effects of pain medication: skin itching, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting, etc.Can be improved by adjusting the dosage.

3. Use patient-controlled analgesia (PCA): The goal of treatment is to use the minimum amount of medication so that the patient does not feel pain while lying in bed, although mild pain may still be felt during severe coughing or movement, with the pain being significantly reduced.

4. Duration of PCA use: Pain gradually decreases over 2–3 days after surgery. Oral analgesics can then be switched to, and PCA can be discontinued.

5. Differences between PCA and traditional analgesia:

(1) PCA delivers medication continuously through a machine; patients can press a button themselves when experiencing particularly severe pain to reduce it.

(2) Traditional analgesia is administered only when pain becomes intolerable; the medication starts working after 30 minutes and lasts for 4–6 hours.

6. The anesthesiologist will set the dosage and timing of PCA based on the patient's individual conditions, and will continuously monitor the patient's condition during use to adjust the dosage accordingly. Therefore, addiction or overdose is avoided.

7. The anesthesiologist will assess the patient's condition. PCA is contraindicated if the patient shows signs of altered consciousness, low blood pressure, hypovolemia, or septic shock.

8. Traditional analgesia is covered by the national health insurance; PCA is not covered and must be paid for out-of-pocket.## 8. Postoperative Rehabilitation Exercises

## Move the walker forward ↓ Step out with the affected limb first ↓ Then step in with the good foot

1. Adjust the walker height so that your elbows are slightly bent.

2. Place your body's center of gravity on the foot that hasn't undergone surgery.

Note: Keep both feet shoulder-width apart and move them in sync.

3. Move the walker forward one step at a time, maintaining an appropriate distance—do not make it too large—to prevent instability and falls.

4. Hold the walker to support your body, stepping first with the affected limb into the red zone to achieve the most stable walking posture. Reminder! Taking large steps increases the risk of falling.

5. Then step forward with the non-surgical foot, without crossing over the affected limb—this is the safest walking method.

Diagram showing bandage wrapping of the limb for the surgical affected side## IX. Ambulatory Activities

1. Day 1 post-surgery: Encourage the patient to remain in a semi-Fowler's position (approximately 70°–90°) as much as possible to prevent orthostatic hypotension when getting up from bed. A gradual transition from bed to standing should be followed: first elevate the head of the bed, wait for 10 minutes without any discomfort, then sit at the edge of the bed for 5–10 minutes. If no dizziness or discomfort occurs, assist the patient in standing with a walker under supervision. Only after confirming no dizziness during standing should the patient use a walker to walk within the hospital room.

2. From day 2 onwards: The patient can walk in the hospital corridor using a walker, four times per day, each session lasting 5 minutes. After activity, when returning to bed, the affected limb should be elevated and ice applied to reduce swelling.

3. The use of a walker should be maintained for at least 6–8 weeks to prevent excessive weight-bearing on the bone before it has fully healed.

## 1. How to Prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis

Avoid prolonged sitting or standing, and when lying in bed, avoid long-term compression of the lower limbs. Do not maintain any posture for too long, such as crossing legs while standing, wearing tight clothing. Maintain a healthy body weight, consume adequate fluids and a low-fat diet, engage in appropriate physical activity, and refrain from smoking.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_592_508_1144_908.jpg" alt="Image" width="46%" /></div>

## Wearing Medical Compression Socks After Surgery

Principles for wearing compression socks:

1. Wear for at least 3 days after surgery.

2. Put them on before getting out of bed in the morning, and remove them when bathing in the evening.

(Suggested: wear for 8 hours per day, for one month)

1. Wash hands before and after touching the wound.

2. Wound disinfection or cleaning should be performed from inside out, without back-and-forth rubbing. The disinfection area should extend approximately 5 cm beyond the wound boundary. When changing the dressing, try to minimize the exposure of the wound to air.

3. Change the dressing once daily (it can be done after bathing). However, if there is blood soaking through the gauze, the gauze gets wet by accident, or the gauze falls off, the dressing must be changed immediately.

4. Keep the wound and gauze clean and dry. Avoid bathing or getting the wound wet. Try to use wiping instead of soaking.

5. Items needed for dressing change:

(1) 20 ml normal saline solution: use once and discard immediately after use.

(2) $ 4 \times 4 $ gauze

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_699_753_1190_1248.jpg" alt="Image" width="41%" /></div>

(3) Sterile cotton swabs

(4) Water-soluble povidone-iodine: keep for one week after opening.

(5) 3M paper tape: if allergic to paper tape, choose an anti-allergy tape instead.

(6) 6-inch elastic bandage (can be washed and reused).### 6. Wound Care Steps:

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_38_129_548_476.jpg" alt="Image" width="42%" /></div>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_664_138_1077_493.jpg" alt="Image" width="34%" /></div>

2. Unwrap the gauze and examine the wound

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_72_555_551_859.jpg" alt="Image" width="40%" /></div>

3. Use a normal saline cotton swab to clean the wound, wiping in a circular motion from the center of the wound outward, gradually expanding to a diameter greater than 5 cm beyond the wound perimeter, avoiding back-and-forth wiping.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_656_557_1090_859.jpg" alt="Image" width="36%" /></div>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_79_1045_563_1333.jpg" alt="Image" width="40%" /></div>

Hold one corner of the gauze, pull it out, align it with the center of the wound, cover the wound, and do not move it again. Secure it with adhesive tape.

4. Use a water-soluble cotton swab to disinfect the wound, wiping in a circular motion from the center of the wound outward, gradually expanding to a diameter greater than 5 cm beyond the wound perimeter, avoiding back-and-forth wiping.

6. Apply compression bandaging as instructed by the doctor, and wear compression stockings accordingly.## Three. Precautions for Home Care

1. Continue performing rehabilitation exercises taught in the hospital every day after returning home.

2. Keep wounds as dry as possible. If redness, swelling, or abnormal exudate occurs, seek medical evaluation promptly.

3. Avoid rubbing or bumping the wound and intense physical activities (such as running or jumping). Adhere to the activity restrictions instructed by your doctor.

4. Use a walking aid for 6–8 weeks post-surgery until your doctor, during follow-up visits, deems it safe to resume normal activities. Take precautions to prevent falls.

5. After prolonged periods of standing or getting up from bed, blood circulation in the affected limb may be slower, leading to swelling in the feet. Therefore, elevate the affected limb and apply ice after getting up to help reduce swelling.

6. The following activities must be approved by your doctor before being performed: driving, half-squatting, lifting heavy objects (over 3 kilograms), long-distance walking, or hiking.

7. When passing through security checkpoints, the machine may alert you that metal items are carried. You may explain the situation to the security officer or provide a hospital surgical certificate.

8. Metal implants, both internal and external (such as artificial joints), prohibit deep heat therapy (e.g., shortwave diathermy), as excessive heat concentration may cause burns.

9. When a patient has a cold or infection in another area or requires dental treatment, proactively inform your doctor about the presence of an artificial joint so that the doctor can assess appropriate medication guidelines.10. When can the wound be exposed to water: Only after the doctor has informed you when it is safe to expose the wound, can you take a shower.

11. If any of the following symptoms occur, you should visit the clinic immediately:

(1) The wound has not healed after a long time, with persistent exudate, odor, or continuous bleeding.

(2) The wound is swollen, the skin around the wound is hot, and the pain at the wound site has not improved.

(3) A fever persists above 38.5°C.

(4) You have slipped or bumped your knee.## Eleven. Home Rehabilitation Program
