## Hearing Impairment - Care Considerations

## ➢ Classification of Hearing Loss:

1. Sensory-neural hearing loss: Causes occur in the inner ear or auditory nerve, such as: exposure to loud noise, occupational injuries, ototoxic drugs, inner ear viral infections, inner ear lymphedema, presbycusis (age-related hearing loss), etc.

2. Conductive hearing loss: Causes occur in the outer or middle ear, such as: earwax blockage, foreign bodies or tumors in the ear canal, middle ear abscess or fluid accumulation, etc.

3. Mixed hearing loss: Combination of both sensory-neural and conductive hearing loss.

## Important Causes to Not Overlook:

1. Inconvenience in daily life and safety concerns, such as: inability to hear phone rings, horn sounds, or alarm bells.

2. Inability to communicate effectively, reluctance to go out, unwillingness to talk to others, and social withdrawal.

3. Depression, suspicion, delusions, and significant mood swings.

4. Lack of sufficient auditory stimulation leading to memory decline, reduced comprehension, and increased risk of developing dementia.

Huh?## ➢ Hearing Loss Management and Care:

1. First, visit an otolaryngology outpatient clinic to identify the cause and receive further treatment.

2. Conduct hearing tests and assessments, and wear appropriate hearing aids, which can help improve quality of life.

(Various types of hearing aids are available based on the degree of hearing loss and lifestyle, such as behind-the-ear, in-the-ear, and pocket-style models)

3. Avoid prolonged exposure to noise and reduce long-term use of earphones.

4. During conversations, speak face-to-face, avoid shouting, use a lower volume, speak slowly and clearly.

5. Do not insert objects into the ears randomly. Earwax has protective functions and can prevent ear infections. If earwax impaction occurs, seek assistance from an otolaryngologist for removal.

## When hearing abnormalities are detected, seek medical examination as soon as possible to take advantage of the opportunity to correct hearing loss.
