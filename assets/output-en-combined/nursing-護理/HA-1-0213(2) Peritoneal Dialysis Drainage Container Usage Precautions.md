# Notes on the Use of Peritoneal Dialysis Drainage Bucket

I. Handling Procedure When the Dialysis Fluid in the Drainage Bucket Appears Cloudy:

1. First assess whether there is abdominal pain or discomfort.

2. Confirm whether the drainage bucket is cleaned regularly.

3. First drain 200cc of dialysis fluid that has been retained in the abdomen for at least 2 hours to observe. If cloudiness is observed, immediately contact the peritoneal dialysis nurse and go to the hospital for further drainage and examination.

| Frequency | Method | Illustration |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| Daily | If the blue sticker on the bottom of the drainage bucket falls off: 1. Obtain a new blue sticker from the peritoneal dialysis room and reattach it. You can use transparent tape to secure it, making it less likely to fall off. 2. You may also attach other patterned stickers or write or draw with oil-based markers. | <img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_829_222_1145_428.jpg"> |
