## Six. How to handle fever in adults?

1. If the fever lasts for one or two days and then resolves on its own, there is usually no need for excessive concern. Simply rest and drink plenty of fluids.

2. If fever is accompanied by chills, difficulty breathing, or if you have recently returned from an epidemic area, seek medical attention immediately.

3. If the fever persists for more than two to three days, or if there are no other symptoms but the fever continues, this may be a sign of infection or another illness. Seek medical attention immediately.

1. When the body's core temperature exceeds 38°C, it indicates a fever.

2. Electronic ear thermometers measure temperatures close to core body temperature; however, for infants under three months old, it is recommended to use axillary or back thermometers, as ear thermometers may be less accurate.

3. Earwax or otitis media may affect ear temperature readings, but these effects usually do not exceed 0.5°C. If the temperatures in both ears differ, use the higher value.

## Two: Does fever harm the body?

1. Fever itself does not directly harm the body or damage the brain. Neurological symptoms may only occur if the infection severely affects the brain.

2. Fever helps enhance the immune system's ability to fight infection. The body's temperature regulation system typically keeps body temperature below 41°C. Extreme high fever, which may occur only in cases of heatstroke or severe metabolic abnormalities, can lead to rhabdomyolysis or kidney damage.

## Three: How to manage fever in children?

1. When to use antipyretics: For children with chronic lung disease, heart disease, anemia, diabetes, or a history of febrile seizures, antipyretics may be considered when body temperature exceeds 38°C. If there are no such comorbidities and no obvious discomfort, fever does not need to be forcibly reduced.

2. Avoid using: Aspirin or other salicylate-based medications should not be used in children under 18 years of age for fever reduction.

3. Physical antipyretic methods: Methods such as ice packs or tepid sponging are ineffective for fevers caused by inflammation and may instead lead to cold extremities.

## Four: What to do if fever persists?

1. Fever is a sign of the immune system functioning. The cycle of fever and recovery may repeat. If the fever does not return within 24 hours, it may indicate improvement in the condition.

2. If a child has a high fever with a risk of complications or is experiencing significant discomfort due to fever, antipyretics of different types may be alternated under medical guidance. However, the recommended dosage should not be exceeded.

## Five: When to seek emergency medical care?

If a child exhibits any of the following symptoms, regardless of whether they have a fever, medical attention should be sought immediately:

1. Fever in infants under three months old.

2. Significantly reduced urine output or inability to cry with tears.

3. Altered mental status, such as drowsiness, agitation, or unresponsiveness.

4. Seizures, muscle twitching, paralysis, or abnormal sensations.

5. Persistent headache or vomiting.

6. Stiff neck.

7. Coughing up blood.

8. Difficulty breathing or apnea.

9. Abnormally slow or irregular heartbeat.

10. Significant decline in activity level, such as inability to climb stairs or becoming breathless after minimal walking.

11. Appearance of purpura on the skin, or bluish discoloration of the lips, fingers, or toes.
