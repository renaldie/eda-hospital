## I. What are hemorrhoids?

Hemorrhoids refer to pathological changes in the venous and arterial plexuses at the end of the rectum and around the anus, resulting in blood clots—this condition is known as hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids can be classified into internal hemorrhoids, external hemorrhoids, and mixed hemorrhoids.

## II. Common causes of hemorrhoids

1. Excessive pressure on the anus during defecation, such as constipation.

2. Poor venous return from the anus, such as during pregnancy, liver cirrhosis, or heart failure.

3. Congenital absence of a fibrous membrane in the hemorrhoidal vascular plexus.

## III. Symptoms of hemorrhoids

1. Pain: Caused by swelling or thrombosis in external hemorrhoids.

2. Bleeding: Due to congestion of blood vessels within the hemorrhoidal tissue, and repeated prolapse leading to mucosal rupture and bleeding.

3. Itching around the anus: Resulting from dysfunction of the anal cushions, causing leakage of liquid feces that irritates the skin and leads to itching.

4. Prolapse: Caused by damage to the supporting tissues, leading to the protrusion of hemorrhoidal tissue outside the anus.

## IV. Treatment

1. Non-surgical treatment

(1) Dietary and medication therapy: Eat more high-fiber vegetables and fruits to establish regular bowel habits.

(2) Rubber band ligation: A small protruding internal hemorrhoid is tied off, and it eventually falls off and dies after one week.

(3) Sclerotherapy: Inject a sclerosing agent into the hemorrhoidal area, causing fibrosis of blood vessels and eventual detachment.

(4) Other treatments: Such as laser therapy or electrocautery.

### 2. Surgical treatment

(1) Hemorrhoidectomy: The protruding hemorrhoidal tissue is removed and sutured.

(2) Stapled hemorrhoidopexy: The relaxed mucosa is removed and sutured, providing a thorough treatment for hemorrhoids.

## V. Postoperative precautions

1. Due to anesthesia, pain, surgical site, or the anal dressing, some patients may experience difficulty in urination. Try listening to the sound of running water or taking a warm sitz bath to stimulate urination. If urination remains difficult, a single catheterization or indwelling catheter may be required.

2. If there is no dizziness or discomfort, encourage early ambulation.

3. After surgery, warm water rinsing or sitz baths can be performed starting at 12 hours post-operation. The water temperature should be between 40.5~43.3°C, performed 2–3 times daily and after defecation. Use a showerhead to thoroughly rinse the area, with each sitz bath lasting 5–10 minutes. This helps reduce pain and swelling at the wound site and promotes wound healing.

## VI. Daily care

1. Develop good bowel habits and avoid prolonged sitting on the toilet.

2. Eat more high-fiber foods such as vegetables and fruits daily, and avoid alcohol, fried foods, and spicy foods.

3. Maintain a regular lifestyle, engage in appropriate physical activity and rest, and avoid staying up late.

4. Avoid maintaining the same posture for long periods while standing or sitting. For those who sit for long periods, it is recommended to move around for 3–4 minutes every hour.
