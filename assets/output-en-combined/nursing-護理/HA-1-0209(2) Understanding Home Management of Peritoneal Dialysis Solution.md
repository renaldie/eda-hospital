# Understanding the Home Management of Peritoneal Dialysis Fluid

## I. Purpose: Proper home management of peritoneal dialysis fluid ensures medication safety and prevents infection.

## II. Recommended Storage Environment for Peritoneal Dialysis Fluid:

(1) Peritoneal dialysis fluid should be stored in a clean, cool indoor area, away from direct sunlight or humid environments, and should not be placed near windows.

(2) Different types of peritoneal dialysis fluid should be stored separately.

(3) The stacking height of boxes should not exceed five boxes to facilitate easy access.

(4) Peritoneal dialysis fluid should be stored in a centralized location, with items having shorter expiration dates placed in front to be used first.

(5) Unused peritoneal dialysis fluid after opening should be placed inside the box and the box lid should be securely closed. Empty boxes should be discarded immediately.

(6) Boxes should not be placed directly on the floor; instead, a plastic mat or soft pad should be used to elevate them by about 2 cm to prevent moisture.

## III. Important Notes Regarding Peritoneal Dialysis Fluid:

(1) Avoid using scissors or knives when opening the box to prevent accidental cuts to the peritoneal dialysis fluid.

(2) When carrying peritoneal dialysis fluid outside, it is recommended to place it in an insulated bag. It is not advisable to place it directly in the back of a vehicle, as high temperatures may damage the fluid.

(3) After receiving the delivery, verify the following items with the driver:

1. The type and quantity of peritoneal dialysis fluid and other accessories are correct.

2. The expiration dates of the peritoneal dialysis fluid and other accessories are not expired, and the boxes are not damaged or damp.## E-DA HEALTHCARE GROUP
