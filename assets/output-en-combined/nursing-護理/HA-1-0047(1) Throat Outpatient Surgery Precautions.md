<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_720_412_1068_784.jpg" alt="Image" width="29%" /></div>## Throat Outpatient Surgery Precautions

## I. Precautions:

1. For patients undergoing general anesthesia, food can be consumed once fully awake. First, try drinking 1–2 sips of liquid food (such as iced water or iced drinks). If no vomiting occurs, then consume semi-liquid foods such as milk powder or clear porridge (not too hot).

2. If there is minor bleeding from the throat, do not panic. Lie still and expel the blood. Rinse your mouth with cold water. If bleeding does not stop, go to the emergency room immediately.

3. Eat cold (such as ice cream or cold beverages) or warm (near body temperature) soft foods temporarily.

4. Avoid spicy, garlic, alcohol, and acidic fruit juices (such as orange juice, grape juice, and tomato juice) until the wound has fully healed, as these may irritate the wound and cause pain.

5. Completely avoid speaking for ___ days. Communicate through non-verbal methods such as hand gestures or written notes.

6. After ___ days, speak softly but not in a whisper. Speak slowly and clearly, ensuring each sentence is understandable. Avoid loud or prolonged speaking.

7. Practice deep breathing to support normal voice production.

8. Maintain oral hygiene by rinsing your mouth with cold water or mouthwash regularly.

9. Drink plenty of fluids to keep the mouth and throat moist.
