ED## Understanding Mitral Valve Prolapse

## 1. What is Mitral Valve Prolapse?

Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is the most common heart valve disorder, affecting approximately 15% to 20% of the population. Women are twice as likely as men to have this condition, especially young women. Most individuals with mild mitral valve prolapse experience no symptoms throughout their lives. Only a small minority (about 1%) may develop serious complications such as severe mitral regurgitation, infective endocarditis, arrhythmias, sudden death, cerebral embolism, and other severe comorbidities.

## 2. Causes:

Most cases of mitral valve prolapse are benign and commonly occur in slender young women or men, or in individuals with abnormal thoracic structure. In these patients, the mitral valve is relatively longer compared to the heart, causing it to prolapse into the left atrium during ventricular contraction. Only a very small number of patients develop mitral regurgitation. A small subset of patients develop abnormal thickening and elongation of the mitral valve due to hereditary connective tissue disorders or other primary causes, leading to more severe prolapse. In severe cases, this may result in elongated chordae tendineae or dilation of the mitral annulus, causing mitral regurgitation, and in extreme cases, heart failure.

## 3. Symptoms:

1. Most patients with mitral valve prolapse are asymptomatic.

2. Common symptoms include:
   (1) Typical or atypical angina pectoris  
   (2) Ambiguous chest pain  
   (3) Palpitations  
   (4) Arrhythmias  
   (5) Chest tightness  
   (6) Shortness of breath or feelings of anxiety and tension  
   (7) Autonomic dysfunction.

## 4. Examination and Diagnosis:

1. Most patients are slender or have abnormal thoracic structure.

2. A clicking sound during mid-ventricular contraction or a murmur at the end of systole may be heard on auscultation.

3. Echocardiography: Two-dimensional echocardiography shows the mitral valve leaflets as relaxed, elongated, and thickened, prolapsing into the left atrium during systole. Color Doppler echocardiography can diagnose the presence and severity of mitral regurgitation.

## 5. Management Principles:

1. If patients experience chest tightness, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, or dizziness, symptomatic treatment with beta-blockers (e.g., Inderal, Tenormin), calcium channel blockers (e.g., Isoptin, Herbesser), and sedatives may be used.

2. For asymptomatic patients without arrhythmias and with no significant changes on electrocardiogram, annual check-ups with a physician are recommended. Echocardiographic follow-up is optional and not necessarily required.

3. In cases of severe mitral valve prolapse and severe mitral regurgitation, surgical repair, surgical intervention, or artificial valve replacement may be considered.

4. A balanced diet, avoidance of smoking, alcohol, and caffeine-containing stimulants, regular physical activity, and stress reduction can help alleviate symptoms.

5. Patients should avoid highly intense or stimulating activities (such as riding roller coasters).

6. When mitral valve prolapse is accompanied by significant mitral regurgitation, oral antibiotics should be administered prophylactically before dental procedures or other invasive treatments to prevent infective endocarditis.

7. The treatment principle focuses on symptom management, psychological support, and improving overall symptom control.
