<div style="text-align: center;">Understanding Fluid Control</div>

| Cause of Fluid Control | When the body has too much fluid, it can lead to pulmonary edema, causing symptoms such as shortness of breath, hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and heart failure. |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Techniques for Fluid Control | 1. It is recommended to use a fixed container to measure the daily fluid intake limit, evenly distributing consumption. The daily fluid intake should be approximately equal to urine output + dialysate fluid removal + 500 ml (fluid loss that is imperceptible).<br>2. Total fluid intake should also include all foods (all foods contain fluid).<br>3. Eat as much dry solid food as possible and avoid foods with high water content, such as porridge, soup noodles, mixing soup with rice, hot pot, jellies, and pudding.<br>4. Avoid fruits with high water content, such as watermelon, papaya, tomatoes, honeydew melon, strawberries, and grapefruit, as these fruits contain over 90% water.<br>5. Engage in moderate exercise to increase sweating, helping to eliminate some fluid. |
| Methods to Alleviate Thirst | 1. Chewing sugar-free gum to stimulate saliva production and alleviate thirst.<br>2. Prepare ice cubes by mixing a portion of water with a little lemon juice; when thirsty, hold the ice cube in the mouth to relieve discomfort.<br>3. Rinse the mouth with hot water, then spit out some of the water and only drink a small amount of water to reduce fluid intake.<br>4. When feeling thirsty, moisten the lips with a cotton swab or rinse the mouth.<br>5. Reduce the use of salty seasonings in food, such as soy sauce, monosodium glutamate (MSG), satay sauce, or fermented bean paste.<br>6. Avoid processed and preserved foods to prevent thirst. |
