A stroke mainly occurs due to blocked blood flow to the brain, leading to oxygen deficiency and resulting in brain function impairment.

Stroke is one of the top ten causes of death among Chinese people. Besides causing significant physical and mental impacts on patients, a stroke also brings great anxiety and distress to families.

## 33## Stroke Stages

## Acute Phase (within one week of stroke)

## Subacute Phase (2 weeks to 6 months)

## Maintenance Phase (after 6 months)

1. Patients should receive professional care in a safe and quiet environment, such as a specialized ward.

2. Reduce the risk of complications such as pneumonia and urinary tract infections, and enter rehabilitation as early as recommended by the doctor.

1. This phase is the golden period for rehabilitation; early rehabilitation greatly helps functional recovery.

2. Patients should actively participate in rehabilitation under professional guidance, set realistic goals, and attempt daily activities (such as dressing and eating).

3. Approximately 40% of patients may be troubled by limb spasticity.

Continue to cooperate with rehabilitation and stroke prevention, and pay attention to cognitive function and emotional well-being.Types of Stroke

Ischemic Stroke

## Causes:

1. Blockage of brain blood vessels leading to blood flow obstruction and impaired blood supply

## Non-cardiac

Due to atherosclerosis of the brain blood vessel walls, causing thickening of the vessel walls and formation of plaques, which gradually narrow the vessel lumen, resulting in:

★ Atherosclerotic cerebral infarction in large arteries: occurs due to blockage in major blood vessels  
★ Lacunar infarction: occurs due to blockage in small blood vessels

Usually associated with the "three highs" (high blood pressure, high blood lipids, high blood sugar)

## Cardiac

Caused by thrombi or plaques becoming lodged in brain blood vessels, leading to blockage:

Often results from thrombi originating in the heart, hence also known as cardiac embolic stroke. Usually associated with arrhythmiaHemorrhagic stroke

Caused by rupture of brain blood vessels, leading to blood clots pressing on the brain and affecting blood supply.

Hemorrhagic stroke

When a hemorrhagic stroke occurs, it causes brain swelling and increased intracranial pressure, thereby damaging brain cells and tissues.

Usually associated with hypertension or an aneurysm.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_636_735_873_995.jpg" alt="Image" width="27%" /></div>

Ischemic stroke: accounts for approximately 70–80% of all strokes  
Hemorrhagic stroke: accounts for approximately 20–30% of all strokes<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_0_1_874_1188.jpg" alt="Image" width="100%" /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_0_0_874_1222.jpg" alt="Image" width="100%" /></div>Stroke Risk Factors

Lifestyle Factors

Overweight

Unhealthy dietary habits

Lack of physical activity

Psychological stress

Depression

Misuse of alcohol or drugs

Smoking

## Ministry of Health and Welfare, National Health Agency

1. Smoking cessation services are available at outpatient clinics, inpatient hospitals, emergency departments, and community pharmacies, funded by the Tobacco Health Welfare Fund.

2. After receiving smoking cessation services, follow-up and counseling are provided at 3 months and 6 months, with continuous support to strengthen motivation and willpower for quitting smoking.

Free smoking cessation hotline: 0800-636363## Stroke Risk Factors

## Other Diseases

## Hypertension

Approximately 50% of strokes are caused by hypertension.

☑ Easily damages the inner lining of blood vessels, leading to cholesterol accumulation and thus accelerating vascular hardening  
◆ Increases the risk of rupturing blood vessels, raising the danger of intracranial hemorrhage

## Diabetes

The risk of stroke increases by 1.5 to 3 times.

It causes vascular degeneration, increased blood viscosity, and vascular hardening. When occurring in the brain, it often results in atherosclerosis of coronary arteries, peripheral arteries, and cerebral arteries, as well as small vessel disease.

## Heart Disease

When the heart muscle or valves have lesions or arrhythmias, blood flow becomes obstructed and prone to clotting, eventually leading to cerebral embolism.

## High Lipid Levels

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_0_916_179_1223.jpg" alt="Image" width="20%" /></div>

➢ High lipid levels are one of the key causes of vascular hardening.  
Elevated cholesterol and triglycerides cause arterial hardening, thereby increasing the risk of stroke.

Some stroke risk factors  
can be improved through lifestyle modifications.  
For example: controlling hypertension, diabetes, and high lipid levels, etc.## Stroke Risk Factors

• Fixed dosing is available and no regular blood monitoring is required

## Advantages

- Compared to warfarin, these drugs have fewer drug interactions and no food interactions

If medication is not taken on time, the risk of blood clot formation increases

• Gastrointestinal side effects may lead to discontinuation of treatment

## Precautions

- In case of bleeding or emergency surgery, consider using antidotes that can rapidly reverse coagulation abnormalities

It is not possible to assess whether anticoagulant effect is within the therapeutic range

• Caution is required when using in patients with renal impairmentStroke Treatment Medications

2. Medication safety is up to you—only then can you enjoy a healthy life

3. Strict control of medications—life is secure

4. Never buy medications without prescription—only then can safety be trusted## Long-term living and rehabilitation after stroke

After neurological function and vital signs have stabilized, rehabilitation plans are actively arranged based on the extent of impairment in motor and cognitive functions. The primary goal of this stage is to enhance self-care abilities, so that patients can live as independently as possible upon returning home and reduce their dependence on caregivers.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_64_412_307_660.jpg" alt="Image" width="27%" /></div>


## Rehabilitation begins during hospitalization

During the acute phase, joint mobilization is the main focus. Once the patient's condition stabilizes, exercises such as turning over, sitting up, repositioning, and using assistive devices can be introduced, followed by learning to walk and hand function to achieve the goal of daily living independence. Patients need to continue rehabilitation after discharge to achieve the best possible functional recovery.

Severity

Management Strategies

Dysphagia

23% to 50% of acute stroke patients will experience dysphagia

Dysphagia increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary infections, and malnutrition, leading to prolonged hospital stays and higher stroke mortality rates.

1. Texture selection: If liquids cause coughing or choking, food thickening agents can be added.  
(The consistency should be adjusted according to the therapist's recommendation.)

2. Posture adjustment: It is recommended to eat in a head-down position, and head-tilt posture should be avoided as much as possible.  
(Please follow the therapist's advice.)

The following signs indicate potential swallowing difficulties:

1. Food remains in the mouth or spills out during eating.  
2. Coughing or choking frequently when eating or swallowing.  
3. Inability to naturally close the corners of the mouth, with saliva leaking from the mouth.## Other Notes

## Daily Life Care

1. Turn the patient every 2~3 hours.

2. Perform passive joint exercises at appropriate times.

3. Keep the skin clean and dry; alternatively, use a foam mattress to prevent pressure sores.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_522_288_778_536.jpg" alt="Image" width="29%" /></div>

4. Pay attention to maintaining airway patency. Encourage the patient to take deep breaths and cough, or have family members assist with back percussion.

5. Suggest adopting a sitting position more often, which can expand lung capacity.

The patient's bed should have protective devices such as bed rails or bed guards. Protective restraints may be provided if necessary to prevent falls or accidental dislodgement of tubes.
