Dear family members,

Thank you for your understanding and support! Our team consists of professional medical staff, including the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) director, attending physicians, resident physicians, specialty nurses, general nurses, respiratory therapists, nutritionists, clinical pharmacists, and social workers. We provide 24-hour care for your loved one, aiming to deliver high-quality treatment and support so that the patient can recover as soon as possible.

**I. Scheduled visiting hours:**

- Morning: 10:30 AM – 11:00 AM  
- Evening: 7:30 PM – 8:00 PM

**II. Pre-visiting guidelines:**

1. Before entering the visiting area, please wash your hands thoroughly and dry them (if using dry hand sanitizer, simply allow them to air dry without rinsing).

2. If any visiting family members have upper respiratory or other infectious diseases, please avoid visiting if possible. If unavoidable, please wear a mask to prevent transmitting pathogens to the patient.

3. Due to children's weaker immune systems, we kindly ask that you avoid bringing children under 12 years old to visit.

4. During visiting hours, please turn off your mobile phones and remain quiet to avoid disturbing the patient’s rest or interfering with medical equipment.

5. If you have questions about the patient’s condition, you may directly ask the physician during visiting hours. To avoid miscommunication, we will not provide explanations over the phone.

6. In cases where the patient’s condition changes and requires emergency treatment or major interventions, visiting hours may be postponed, and the reason for the delay will be explained. However, we will still ensure that the scheduled 30-minute visiting time is fulfilled.

7. Only two family members are allowed to enter the patient’s room at a time to minimize infection risk. Other family members are kindly requested to wait outside.

8. Since patients have various medical tubes in place, please do not move or reposition the patient without the assistance of a nurse. Any movement of the patient must be performed under the guidance of a nurse.

**III. Explanation of isolation and protective restraint measures:**

1. To ensure patient comfort and prevent cross-infection, each ICU room is designed as an independent space.

2. To prevent patients with impaired consciousness from accidentally removing medical tubes—leading to bleeding, infection, or life-threatening conditions—protective restraints may be necessary. We kindly ask for your understanding and cooperation.

**IV. Other important notes:**

1. If you need to obtain diagnostic certificates for your patient’s hospitalization (especially for applications related to agricultural, labor, or workers’ compensation insurance benefits, please obtain the required forms from your original insurance provider first), please bring the patient’s identity card (or household registration book) to the nursing station before discharge. We will process your request promptly.

2. During hospitalization, please ensure that any valuable items on the patient’s body are returned to family members to avoid loss.

3. The hospital strictly prohibits chewing betel nut, bringing pets into the facility, and smoking. Please cooperate with these rules to maintain a clean environment and ensure the health and well-being of the patient and family members.

**V. The following are guidelines established by the Central Health Insurance Bureau, Ministry of Health and Welfare, regarding the transfer of patients out of the ICU. We will assess your family member’s condition and transfer them out of the ICU when appropriate, to ensure that ICU beds are used efficiently for patients with critical conditions:**
