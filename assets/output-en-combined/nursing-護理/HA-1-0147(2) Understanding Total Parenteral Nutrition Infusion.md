## What precautions should be taken during total parenteral nutrition (TPN) therapy?

1. Infusion will be administered over 24 hours, using a drip pump to control the rate. If you notice any bleeding, moisture, loose tubing, or redness, warmth, or discomfort at the injection site, please inform the medical staff immediately.

2. During the treatment period, blood glucose levels, nutritional status, and blood electrolyte concentrations will be monitored.

3. The physician will assess when it is safe to start eating, and you will need to record your intake and output. The physician will determine when to discontinue the parenteral nutrition infusion.

## What is Total Parenteral Nutrition?

Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) involves delivering the body's required proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals through large blood vessels via a high-nutrient, high-concentration solution to maintain bodily needs. The so-called "nutrition injection" typically refers only to a solution containing glucose and a small amount of amino acids (proteins) administered intravenously. This is quite different in concentration from total parenteral nutrition.

## Components of Total Parenteral Nutrition

1. Carbohydrates: Provide energy.

2. Lipid emulsions: Provide energy.

3. Amino acids: Support tissue repair.

4. Electrolytes: Sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, phosphate, acetate.

5. Vitamins: Both fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins.

6. Trace elements: Cobalt, chromium, manganese, zinc.

## Who needs total parenteral nutrition?

1. Cancer patients with insufficient food intake due to illness or treatment, requiring improvement in nutritional status.

2. Patients who need temporary fasting or have gastrointestinal dysfunction, receiving nutritional support via intravenous means.

3. Severe trauma: such as burns or severe abdominal trauma.

4. Patients diagnosed with moderate to severe malnutrition.

5. Newborns with congenital abnormalities: such as short bowel syndrome.

6. Preterm infants: with low birth weight.
