(1) Use patient-controlled analgesia: The goal of treatment is to use the minimum effective dose of medication so that the patient can rest in bed without feeling pain, although mild pain may still be felt during severe coughing or movement, with the pain intensity significantly reduced.

(2) Duration of patient-controlled analgesia: After 2–3 days post-surgery, pain gradually decreases over time and can be managed with oral analgesics; at this point, patient-controlled analgesia should be discontinued.

3) Differences between patient-controlled analgesia and traditional analgesia:

(1) Patient-controlled analgesia delivers medication continuously through a machine, and patients can press a button themselves when they feel particularly painful to reduce their pain.

(2) Traditional analgesia is administered only when pain becomes intolerable; the medication begins to take effect after 30 minutes and lasts for 4–6 hours.

(3) Traditional analgesia is covered by the public health insurance; patient-controlled analgesia requires out-of-pocket payment.

## You Have the Right to Say "Pain"

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_1168_328_1616_845.jpg" alt="Image" width="26%" /></div>## You Have the Right to Say You're in Pain

## 1. What is Pain?

Pain is a feeling of discomfort or suffering. It may be constant or intermittent, and it can be dull, sharp, or stabbing. Regardless of the type of pain you feel, only you can describe your own experience.

## 2. The Impact of Pain

Pain is a subjective sensation of suffering. Physiologically, it can lead to anxiety, insomnia, reduced appetite, increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, and endocrine dysfunction.

Only you can describe your pain. Be brave and tell your doctor or nurse about your pain concerns. Through proper expression, assessment, and treatment, 90% of pain can be effectively relieved.

You can communicate your pain to medical staff by:

- Describing where the pain is, or pointing to the location with your hand.
- Informing them when the pain first started, how often it occurs, and how long each episode lasts.
- Describing the sensation of the pain—for example, dull, sharp, or stabbing.
- Informing them whether the pain has affected your daily routine—for example, making it difficult to sleep.

We recommend using a "Pain Assessment Scale" to describe your pain level: 0 means no pain, and 10 means the worst possible pain.

## 3. Common Pain Relief Methods

## 1. Traditional Pain Relief:

(1) Oral Medication:

For mild pain, take medication as prescribed by your doctor. Even if you currently feel no pain, continue taking it as directed, as this helps achieve better pain control.

(2) Intramuscular or Intravenous Injection (non-steroidal or morphine-based analgesics):

Individuals vary in their pain tolerance and absorption rates. The duration of action is limited, and medication must be administered at fixed intervals as prescribed by a doctor, or used for sudden, acute pain episodes.

2. Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA):

The anesthesiologist evaluates and selects the appropriate method and route of administration. A machine delivers medication, with preset safe dosages and lockout intervals, allowing the patient to control the dosage themselves.

## 4. Non-Pharmacological Methods to Alleviate Pain

1. Engage in activities to divert attention from pain, such as listening to music, playing cards, playing mahjong, or walking.

2. Maintain a relaxed and positive mindset. For example, having companionship from family or friends can provide psychological support and help reduce your perception of pain.

3. Position your body in the posture that feels most comfortable to you.

4. Use religious beliefs, such as chanting or praying, to shift your focus away from pain.

5. Ask your treating physician whether cold or hot compresses can help reduce your pain.

6. If your pain becomes unbearable, you can still inform medical staff and request adjustments to your pain medication.

## 5. Common Questions About Pain

1. Pain relievers used previously do not interfere with wound healing. In fact, pain relief may allow you to get out of bed earlier, which helps promote wound healing.

2. Side effects of pain medications—such as skin itching, dizziness, nausea, or vomiting—can be improved by adjusting the dosage.

3. With patient-controlled analgesia, the anesthesiologist will assess your individual condition and set appropriate dosage and timing. During use, the dosage will be adjusted regularly based on your condition, so there is no risk of drug addiction or overdose.
