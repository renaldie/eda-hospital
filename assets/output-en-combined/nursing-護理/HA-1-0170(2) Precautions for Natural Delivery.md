2. During the cohabitation period, encourage mothers to rest with their children, and have companions provide additional assistance to care for the infants.

## Eight. Family Planning

1. After childbirth, if there are no physical discomforts, sexual activity can begin during weeks 4–6 postpartum. However, contraception should be used. The ideal contraceptive method should be safe, reversible, affordable, side-effect-free, convenient to use, highly effective, not affecting sexual life, and acceptable to both spouses.

2. Women who are breastfeeding should avoid using oral contraceptives.

Nine. After childbirth, on working days from 08:00 to 17:00, both parties must present their identification documents to the postpartum ward nursing station to apply for the birth certificate. Reference materials

## Post-Natural Delivery Precautions

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_630_352_1043_673.jpg" alt="Image" width="34%" /></div>## Postpartum Care Guidelines for Natural Birth

## 1. Uterine Involution

The restoration of a woman's reproductive system to its pre-pregnancy size and functional state is known as involution, which takes about 6 weeks. The period from postpartum days 3 to 4 is the phase with the fastest changes during the entire involution process.

## 2. Uterine Massage

1. Uterine massage can be performed at any time within the first 24 hours postpartum to prevent poor uterine contraction leading to excessive bleeding. A well-contracted uterus feels firm, with a hardness similar to that of a grapefruit.

2. Lie flat with knees bent to relax abdominal tension and facilitate uterine massage. One hand should be placed on the pubic symphysis for support, while the other hand rests flat, using the palm to gently perform circular massage on the uterine fundus. Continue massaging from a soft state until the uterus becomes firm like a ball. Stop only when it reaches this firmness; if it softens again, continue massaging.

## 3. Observation and Management of Lochia

1. After delivery, monitor the amount of lochia. If a sanitary pad becomes completely saturated within one hour or if large blood clots are observed, notify medical staff immediately.

2. The color of lochia changes as follows: red in the first 1–3 days postpartum, serous lochia from days 4 to 10, and white lochia from day 10 to 4 weeks postpartum. In the first 3 days after delivery, lochia volume is high and requires changing sanitary pads every 3–4 hours. The volume will gradually decrease thereafter.

## 4. Perineal Wound Care

1. Perineal wounds are closed with absorbable sutures and typically heal within 7–14 days, with the suture ends naturally falling out.

2. Sit or lie on the side to reduce pressure on the perineal wound. When getting up from bed, move legs together to avoid pulling the wound.

3. After each bowel movement, rinse the external genital area with warm water from front to back, and change sanitary pads promptly to maintain cleanliness.

## 5. Postpartum Urination

1. Women should attempt to urinate independently within 6 hours after delivery. If urinary retention occurs and the woman cannot urinate on her own, methods such as perineal washing, holding an ice pack, or listening to the sound of running water can be used to stimulate urination.

2. If a woman still feels the urge to urinate after her first attempt, she may try again after one hour. Nurses will assess bladder distension and urinary function. If necessary, catheterization will be provided.

## 6. Postpartum Diet

1. High-protein foods such as fish, meat, eggs, and dairy products help restore the fatigue and repair tissue damage sustained during childbirth, and also promote milk production during postpartum breastfeeding.

2. Increase intake of vegetables and fruits to maintain smooth bowel movements.

3. Postpartum dietary restrictions:

(1) When taking uterine contraction agents, avoid consuming Sheng Hua Tang simultaneously. If increased bleeding occurs after taking Sheng Hua Tang, discontinue use immediately to prevent massive hemorrhage.

(2) Avoid alcohol and sesame oil for one week after delivery. Ginseng should only be consumed after lochia has ceased.

(3) Avoid consuming leek and raw malted barley, as these can affect milk production.

## 7. Activity and Rest

1. Postpartum women should maintain appropriate physical activity to promote lochia discharge and wound healing.
