## Understanding the Types of Peritoneal Dialysis Fluid

Peritoneal dialysis fluid is tailored to a patient's condition by using different glucose concentrations and adjusting dwell time to achieve optimal fluid, electrolyte balance, and toxin clearance.

I. Glucose-containing peritoneal dialysis fluids:

(1) Based on different glucose concentrations, peritoneal dialysis fluids can be divided into three types: 1.5%, 2.5%, and 4.25%. The 1.5% and 2.5% glucose concentration dialysis fluids utilize osmotic pressure differences to remove toxins and excess fluid from the body, causing less damage to the peritoneum.

(2) The 4.25% glucose concentration dialysis fluid has a higher osmotic pressure difference, enabling faster dehydration. When severe edema occurs, this fluid can enhance fluid removal from the body, reducing edema and respiratory distress. However, due to its high glucose concentration, it causes greater damage to the peritoneum and should not be used frequently. It is not recommended to keep it in the abdominal cavity for more than 4 hours, and it should not be used at night, as this may lead to peritoneal function deterioration.

(3) The choice of fluid concentration depends on the degree of edema and blood pressure levels. When using high-concentration fluids, one must monitor changes in fluid loss and blood pressure, as well as potential increases in blood glucose levels.

(4) If symptoms such as weight gain, rapid breathing, elevated blood pressure, edema in the limbs, or pitting edema under the skin occur:

Treatment: Limit fluid intake, use high-concentration fluid to promote fluid excretion, and contact the nurse promptly.

(5) If symptoms such as weight loss, dry skin, dry mouth and tongue, low blood pressure, hoarseness, or tinnitus occur:

Treatment: Switch to low-concentration fluid, increase fluid and salt intake, temporarily discontinue blood pressure-lowering medications, and contact the nurse promptly.## E-DA HEALTHCARE GROUP

(6) In peritoneal dialysis solutions, calcium ion concentration is divided into two types: regular calcium and low-calcium formulations. The choice between these formulations should be made by a physician based on the patient's blood calcium level.

(7) The volume of peritoneal dialysis solution varies. The dual-bag system currently offers two specifications: 2000 cc and 2500 cc; the fully automated dialysis system currently offers two specifications: 2500 cc and 5000 cc.

Two, Non-glucose peritoneal dialysis solutions:

(1) 7.5% Enteral is a starch-based polysaccharide polymer that is metabolized and absorbed more slowly in the body. For long-term dwell, one bag should be retained for at least 8 hours to achieve optimal fluid removal. It is recommended to use this solution before bedtime or during prolonged daytime activities. A single bag can be retained for 8 to 16 hours, resulting in fluid removal of approximately 400 to 1000 ml.

(2) After metabolism, starch-based polysaccharide polymers are converted into maltose, which can interfere with blood glucose measurements and cause false high glucose readings. Glucose oxidase test strips must be used for accurate detection.

(3) According to the National Health Insurance regulations, one bag per day is prescribed for patients with poor fluid removal, diabetic patients with hemoglobin A1c greater than 7, or those who have developed peritonitis.
