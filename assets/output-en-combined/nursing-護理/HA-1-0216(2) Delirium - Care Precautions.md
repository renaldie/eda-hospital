Delirium is an acute, short-term state of mental confusion, typically caused by "physiological abnormalities."  
Most cases can be improved by addressing the underlying triggers, and symptoms can gradually resolve. If not improved, it may lead to substantial medical costs, serious complications such as falls, pressure injuries, prolonged hospital stays, higher likelihood of admission to long-term care facilities, and even increased mortality rates.

Disorientation—incorrect perception of people, time, or place, for example, not recognizing familiar individuals.  
Inability to concentrate, experiencing hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that aren't there), delusions, answering questions incorrectly, or speaking incoherently.  
✿ Reversal of day and night—nocturnal agitation and insomnia, while being drowsy or sleeping during the day.  
♦ Drowsiness, lying in bed without movement or eating/drinking, or becoming agitated and uncooperative with medical treatment.  
Significant mood fluctuations within a short period—manifesting as anxiety, depression, or agitation.  
☐ Duration of symptoms: may last for days, weeks, or even months.

## How to treat?

First, address the causes of delirium, such as treating infections, adjusting medications, managing pain, resolving constipation or urinary retention. If the patient is overly agitated or disruptive during treatment, low-dose antipsychotic medications may be given.

|---|---|
| 1. | Provide sufficient fluids and nutrition to maintain electrolyte balance. Serve foods the patient likes, but first consult the medical and nursing team about which foods are contraindicated. |
| 2. | Use aids such as glasses, hearing aids, writing boards, or picture cards to facilitate communication. Communicate using low-pitched, gentle tones and short, clear sentences. |
| 3. | Keep curtains open during the day and frequently remind the patient of the current date, time, location, floor, reason for hospitalization, and current treatments. |
| 4. | Use clocks, watches, calendars, and familiar items such as photos or radios to enhance orientation regarding people, time, place, and objects. |
| 5. | Increase daytime activities to maintain alertness and avoid drowsiness. Examples include going for walks, sunbathing, interacting with family members, playing familiar music, watching TV, or participating in community activities. |
| 6. | Assist the patient to get out of bed or sit in a wheelchair or perform limb exercises at least three times a day to reduce daytime bed rest and prevent complications such as pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. |
| 7. | Provide appropriate rest and sleep at night, but avoid excessive or inappropriate use of sedatives or sleep aids. |
| 8. | Avoid physical restraints unless absolutely necessary, as physical restraint may increase the patient's emotional agitation and restrict movement, leading to functional decline. |
