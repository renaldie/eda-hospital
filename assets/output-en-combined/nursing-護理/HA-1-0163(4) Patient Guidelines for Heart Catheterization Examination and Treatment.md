The terrifying nature of cardiovascular disease lies in the fact that patients may suddenly die without warning, leaving people completely unprepared. Most members of the general public often overlook the possibility of a sudden cardiac event. The most common form of heart disease in adults is narrowing and blockage of the coronary arteries, medically known as coronary artery disease—commonly referred to as angina. Like all organs in the body, the heart requires blood vessels to supply oxygen-rich blood. The heart receives oxygen-rich blood through three coronary arteries. As long as these vessels remain healthy, the heart can maintain normal function. However, when the coronary arteries narrow or become blocked, reducing oxygen supply to the heart muscle, chest pain occurs. The heart muscle becomes oxygen-deprived, leading to impaired contraction and reduced blood output. In severe cases, the conduction system responsible for regulating heart rhythm may be damaged, resulting in heart failure or arrhythmia, which can ultimately lead to death.

## Two: Types and Methods of Treatment

## Generally, medical treatment is broadly divided into:

## (1) Prevention and Control of Risk Factors

This includes avoiding high-fat and high-cholesterol foods, adopting a low-salt diet, increasing intake of vegetables and fruits, controlling blood pressure, managing blood sugar levels, completely quitting smoking, maintaining a regular lifestyle, and engaging in regular physical activity. The ideal exercise regimen is to exercise three times per week, for 30 minutes each session.

## (2) Medication Therapy

Medication therapy can improve heart function, reduce the frequency of episodes, and alleviate symptoms. However, it cannot restore narrowed arteries. Currently, several types of medications are available to either increase oxygen supply to the heart or reduce oxygen demand, such as nitrates, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and antiplatelet agents.

## (3) Interventional Treatments

If medication therapy is ineffective, patients may undergo catheterization to assess whether the lesion is suitable for percutaneous interventions such as balloon angioplasty or stent placement, or whether coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery is required.

Cardiac catheterization involves using specially designed sterile catheters inserted through the femoral artery (in the thigh, near the knee) or the radial artery (in the wrist) to examine the coronary arteries for stenosis or blockages. If a stenotic lesion is found, percutaneous balloon angioplasty may be performed to expand the narrowed area, or a stent may be implanted.

### 1. Balloon Angioplasty

(1) Place the guiding catheter at the opening of the coronary artery: as shown in the left image below

(2) Insert the wire through the guiding catheter: as shown in the right image below

## Four. What are the complications of cardiac catheterization?

Severe complications include arrhythmia, acute myocardial infarction, vascular injury, stroke, renal dysfunction caused by contrast agent, and cardiac tamponade, with an average incidence of less than 1%.

## Five. Precautions during cardiac catheterization

## (1) Before catheterization:

1. Physiological assessment: blood draw, electrocardiogram, X-ray examination.

2. Informed consent: must include consent and signature from both the patient and family.

3. Skin preparation: to reduce infection during the procedure, it is recommended to shave both inguinal areas (common sites are wrists or inguinal regions).

4. Fasting: If the procedure is scheduled for the next morning, fast after midnight (including water and food). If the procedure is scheduled in the afternoon, eat breakfast (finish by 7 AM), and then begin fasting (including water and food) after breakfast.

5. On the day of the examination, remove all metal accessories and removable dentures. If nail polish or lipstick is applied, clean it thoroughly.

6. Wear patient's clothing on the day of the examination, without underwear or pants.

7. Medical history: if you have a history of allergies (such as previous allergic reaction to contrast agents) or persistent bleeding, please inform the physician in advance.

8. Pulse examination: nursing staff will measure your blood pressure and pulse, and mark the pulse points on both feet to facilitate comparison of pulse strength before and after the procedure.

9. Empty your bladder before the examination.

## (2) During catheterization:

1. Local disinfection and anesthesia are performed. A special catheter is inserted through a blood vessel at the arm or inguinal area, and guided along the vessel to reach the heart.2. You will be conscious during the procedure. You may be asked to cough forcefully during the process to promote coronary artery blood flow.

3. During the injection of the contrast agent, you might feel sensations such as whole-body warmth, nausea, or vomiting. Please do not worry—these sensations will disappear quickly.

4. If you experience any discomfort such as chest tightness, chills, fever, palpitations, or shortness of breath during the procedure, please immediately inform the medical staff.

## (Three) After Catheterization:

1. If the examination site is the wrist, medical personnel will apply a pressure band or gauze with a wide adhesive ring around the puncture site. Gradually, part of the wide adhesive will be removed after 4 hours, and the entire band will be completely removed the next morning. A new dressing will be applied to prevent the waterproof film from peeling off. Avoid using the affected limb, and do not lift heavy objects for one week after the procedure.

2. If the examination site is the groin, and the catheter has already been removed in the examination room, medical staff will apply direct pressure with a pressure device for 30 minutes to stop bleeding. Then, a sandbag weighing approximately 2 kilograms will be placed on the puncture site for 4 hours. The puncture site should not be bent, and the sandbag should remain in place. After removing the sandbag, you must remain flat on your back for 4–6 hours without turning over to prevent bleeding. You may then adopt a semi-sitting position. If there is no wound bleeding, you may get up and move around after being checked by medical staff.

3. For femoral artery catheterization at the groin with the catheter not yet removed, you must lie flat before the catheter is withdrawn. After catheter removal, apply a sandbag for 4 hours and remain flat for 6 hours. You may move your buttocks left and right, but the joint of the affected limb must remain straight—do not bend or exert force. The ankle may move freely. After the procedure, you may adopt a semi-sitting position. If there is no wound bleeding, you may get up and move around after being checked by medical staff.

4. After returning to the room, you should rest completely in bed for 4 hours. Due to prolonged lying down, if you need to urinate, please use a commode or urinal. If you have not urinated after 6 hours, please inform the nursing staff. For patients with wounds at the groin area, nursing staff should assist with using a commode or diaper when defecating.

5. Try to minimize getting up and avoid straining during bowel movements within 24 hours. If you experience difficulty in defecation, please inform the medical staff immediately to prevent bleeding from the wound.

6. Nursing staff will continuously monitor your vital signs, blood circulation, and temperature of the upper or lower limbs.

7. If you experience any discomfort such as nausea, vomiting, palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, bleeding, coldness, paleness, numbness, pain, abnormal swelling, bruising, or wet and hot dressing with pain on the side of the examination limb, please inform the medical staff immediately.

8. After returning to the room, you may resume normal eating. If there are no special contraindications (e.g., liver or kidney disease), it is recommended to drink plenty of water to help eliminate the contrast agent.

9. The next morning after the examination, nursing staff will remove the dressing, disinfect the wound, and cover it with gauze and waterproof film. If there are no complications, you may bathe with water the following day, and the gauze can be removed the day after.

10. On the day after the examination, there may be minor bruising around the wound. Please inform the doctor for inspection. The bruising will gradually fade over two to three weeks.## Six. Daily Care Guidelines

1. For the first week after returning home, avoid intense physical activities or excessive flexion of the hip or knee joints, such as mountain climbing, rapid going up and down stairs, or lifting heavy objects.

2. Avoid overeating; instead, consume more vegetables and moderate amounts of fruits, and avoid straining during bowel movements.

3. If, after discharge, you experience pain, swelling, persistent bleeding, or bruising at the wound site, return to the hospital immediately for follow-up.

4. Take medications regularly. The primary function of these medications is to prevent re-occlusion or re-stenosis of blood vessels. If you experience any adverse effects from the medication, discuss it with your doctor and adjust the treatment accordingly—do not stop taking the medication on your own.

5. Attend regular follow-up appointments, as some patients may experience recurrent chest pain, which could indicate a re-occlusion of blood vessels. Such re-occlusion often occurs within the first six months after surgery.

<img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_553_673_743_845.jpg" alt="Image" width="11%" />
</div>

1. What is the rate of re-occlusion after percutaneous coronary intervention?

After balloon angioplasty alone, the rate of restenosis reaches 30% to 40% within three to six months. Therefore, most patients receive stent placement following balloon angioplasty. After placing a conventional metal stent, the rate of restenosis within one year drops to 12% to 18%. With drug-coated stents, the rate of restenosis within one year decreases to 5–9%, approximately halving the risk of re-occlusion compared to conventional metal stents.
