## Cancer Diet – Introduction

During the journey of cancer treatment, diet is one of the most important aspects. Proper and safe nutritional care helps maintain physical health, prevents weight loss, reduces treatment-related side effects, improves treatment tolerance, and ensures smooth completion of therapy.

## I. Pre-treatment Nutritional Assessment & Dietary Principles

Assess your nutritional status using BMI (Body Mass Index), weight loss condition, and blood albumin concentration. If any of the following conditions are present, you may be at risk of malnutrition:

1. BMI < 18.5 kg/m²  
• Ideal BMI range is 18.5–24 kg/m²  
For example, a person with a height of 160 cm and a weight of 50 kg  

2. Weight loss > 5% over one month  

3. Blood albumin < 3.0 g/dL  

Adjust nutritional intake based on current nutritional status  

※ Maintain weight and prevent muscle loss ※  

1. Maintain a balanced diet.  
2. Establish regular physical activity habits.  

※ Increase body weight and muscle mass ※  

1. Supplement with high-calorie, high-quality protein foods, such as seafood tofu porridge, chicken and cauliflower stewed rice, sesame milk, etc.  
2. Supplement with immune-regulating nutrients: fish oil, glutamine, nucleotides to reduce inflammatory substances and enhance immunity, such as deep-sea fish and meat products.  
3. When appetite is poor, eat small meals frequently and supplement with snacks between meals.  
4. Increase physical activity to prevent muscle loss; moderate to high-intensity resistance training (e.g., brisk walking, climbing stairs) is recommended.  

## II. Dietary Principles During Treatment  

1. Balanced diet with natural foods: Include six major food groups and consume them in balance daily. Avoid processed and preserved foods.

2. Strengthen the body with high-quality protein: Protein requirements increase during treatment. High-quality protein sources include soybeans, edamame, tofu, fish, shrimp, crab, eggs, poultry, red meat, and dairy products.  

3. Prevent infection and ensure food safety: Avoid raw foods (including raw diets), such as raw lettuce, raw fish slices, and honey. Pay attention to drinking water (must be boiled) and ice source. Choose fruits with skin on to reduce the risk of bacterial and microbial infections.  

4. Assess eating ability and choose appropriate texture: Based on dental condition and swallowing ability, select soft, mashed, or liquid textures. Avoid rough or hard-to-digest foods such as fried foods and glutinous rice products.
