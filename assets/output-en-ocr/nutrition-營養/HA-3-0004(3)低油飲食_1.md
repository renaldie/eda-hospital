## Low-fat diet

A diet in which the daily fat intake is less than 50 grams, and whose nutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, and other substances are sufficient to meet the body's health requirements.

Reduces the burden on the pancreas or intestines, decreases stimulation of the gallbladder, and lowers blood lipid concentration, thereby improving conditions such as pancreatitis, gallstones, gallbladder inflammation, chylothorax, diarrhea, or hyperlipidemia.

## Choose plant-based oils; daily consumption of 2–3 tablespoons

Examples: soybean oil, olive oil, sunflower seed oil, canola oil, corn oil, grape seed oil, sesame oil, etc.

Oils with high unsaturated fat content (over 85%) should not be heated for cooking to reduce the formation of free radicals and carcinogenic substances.

Meat should be lean; any attached fat and skin should be completely removed.

When selecting lean meat, choose according to fat content in descending order: fish (excluding fish belly meat) → chicken, duck → beef, lamb, pork.

Cook using methods such as steaming, boiling, stewing, braising, roasting, marinating, or cold-dressing, without adding oil. Avoid frying or deep-frying.
