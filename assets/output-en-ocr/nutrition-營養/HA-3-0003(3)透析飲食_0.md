## Peritoneal Dialysis

- **Calories**: During dialysis, the body tissues absorb glucose from the dialysate. Patients require fewer calories from dietary sources than the general population. Due to the potential for increased blood triglyceride levels, single-sugar and excessive fat intake should be avoided, such as sugary foods, fried foods, and butter-based products.

- **Protein**: Peritoneal dialysis results in greater protein loss compared to hemodialysis. Therefore, intake of high biological value proteins should be increased (approximately 6–8 servings of soy products, fish, eggs, and meat per day).

- **Sodium, potassium, and water**: Intake is relatively free, as long as fluid and electrolyte imbalances are managed to control edema.

- **Other**: Following the principles of hemodialysis, patients are encouraged to engage in moderate physical activity or develop a regular exercise routine.
