With the trend of population aging, chronic kidney disease has become a significant challenge to human health. The number of patients with end-stage renal disease worldwide continues to rise, leading to increasingly high medical care costs. In Taiwan, the prevalence and incidence of patients with uremia requiring long-term dialysis have consistently ranked first globally. The enormous consumption of medical resources is self-evident. Public awareness of kidney health, prevention of kidney diseases, and control of chronic kidney disease are issues that all citizens must seriously address.

In March 2005, the Nephrology Department team at Yida Healthcare System began actively promoting public education on chronic kidney disease, and in June of the same year, was officially recognized by the Taiwan Nephrology Society as a "Chronic Kidney Disease Health Promotion Institution." In June 2006, the "Chronic Kidney Disease Health Education Room" was formally established, simultaneously launching active initiatives in patient education, individual case management, and continuing education for medical and nursing staff. Subsequently, the institution was recognized by the National Health Bureau as a "Level 1 Chronic Kidney Disease Health Promotion Institution" and was selected among the top five hospitals for excellence. In January 2017, the Yida Healthcare System's nephrology care team, driven by its consistent dedication and commitment to patient service, passed the Clinical Care Program Certification (CCPC) by the Joint Commission International (JCI), becoming the first hospital in Taiwan to have a "End-Stage Renal Disease Care Program" as its focus. Subsequent evaluations, including the second JCI-CCPC assessment and the Chronic Kidney Disease Care Certification by the Medical Council in November 2021, further demonstrate Yida Healthcare System's firm determination and sustained efforts in renal disease care.

To expand its services in chronic kidney disease prevention and management, the Yida Healthcare System has established "Chronic Kidney Disease Health Education Rooms" at Yida Hospital, Yida Cancer Treatment Hospital, and Dachang Hospital. This "Chronic Kidney Disease Health Education Handbook" is the result of collaborative efforts by the Nephrology Department, the Chronic Kidney Disease Health Education Rooms, and the Nutrition Team within the Yida Healthcare System. The content is comprehensive and concise, covering topics such as kidney physiology, causes of kidney disease, related symptoms, laboratory test explanations, treatment principles for medications and diet, and an understanding of renal replacement therapies—including hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplantation. Through this handbook, the Yida Healthcare Team sincerely hopes to help patients and their families gain a deeper understanding of kidney disease and to serve as a solid support during their journey in fighting kidney disease.
