## ☑ Kidney Replacement Therapy: Shared Decision-Making, Kidney "Strike," What Should I Do?

When the course of kidney disease has progressed to the end-stage of chronic renal failure, it means the kidneys' function has gradually become unable to meet the body's demands. Toxins, electrolytes, and even fluids begin to accumulate in the body and are no longer effectively excreted (some patients may have frequent urination, but because most toxins remain in the body and are not excreted, their urine appears pale and watery). Especially when kidney function (eGFR) drops to just 5–10 ml/min, medication and dietary management are typically no longer effective in controlling the condition. At this stage, kidney replacement therapy must be chosen to take over the functions of severely damaged kidneys, thereby extending your life and enabling you to maintain a certain quality of life.

When a patient reaches stage 5 of chronic kidney disease, they can begin considering and preparing for kidney replacement therapy (dialysis). To ensure that you and your family fully understand kidney replacement therapy, or if you and your family are unclear about how to choose the appropriate form of therapy, it is recommended that you seek professional medical and nursing advice and work together with healthcare providers to discuss your options. This shared decision-making process will enhance your understanding and awareness of kidney replacement therapy and help you select the most suitable treatment for your individual needs.

Kidney replacement therapy includes hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplantation. Each of these treatment methods has its own advantages and disadvantages. With current medical technology, all three options offer high-quality care. Below, we will introduce each method in detail, aiming to help you establish a correct understanding of uremic treatment and serve as a reference for your future treatment decisions.
