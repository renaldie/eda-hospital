## Hemodialysis

Hemodialysis involves using an extracorporeal circulation to purify the blood. First, a surgical procedure is performed to establish a venous-arterial shunt, after which dialysis treatment can begin one to three months later. During treatment, two needles are inserted into the shunt. Blood flows out through one needle into the outside environment, where it passes through an artificial kidney to remove toxins and excess water. The purified blood is then returned to the body through the other needle.

Patients attend the hemodialysis center three times per week, with each session lasting approximately four hours. Since hemodialysis cannot continuously remove waste substances from the blood like a normal kidney does, patients must strictly limit their diet, especially restricting salt, water, and potassium intake.
