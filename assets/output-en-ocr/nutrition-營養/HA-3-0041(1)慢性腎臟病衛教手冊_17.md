### 9. Other Notes:

Patients with cardiovascular diseases should reduce their intake of fats and choose plant-based healthy fats, which can help control blood cholesterol levels, reduce the risk of atherosclerosis, and lower the likelihood of blood clots.

(1) Choose oils with higher unsaturated fat content during cooking, such as: canola oil, soybean salad oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, corn oil, safflower oil, bitter tea oil, flaxseed oil, etc.

(2) Reduce intake of foods high in saturated fats and trans fats, such as: fatty meats, fatty skin, fried foods, oily pastries, lard, ghee, full-fat dairy, cream, coconut oil, and lactose-based products like lactose.

Since each patient's condition is different, for more detailed information, please contact a dietitian for personalized dietary guidance.
