### 6. Principles of Water Restriction Diet

- For chronic kidney disease patients who exhibit severe edema and are advised by their doctor to limit fluid intake, daily fluid intake should be estimated as the previous day's urine output plus 500 to 700 milliliters of water, or based on the principle of avoiding edema.

(Daily body weight change should not exceed 0.5 kilograms)

· Tips for fluid control:

(1) Monitor daily body weight changes.

(2) Avoid consuming soups and broths.

For example, during strict fluid restriction, avoid soups, vegetable broth, meat broth, and drinks.

(3) Prefer solid foods over liquid foods.

For example, dry rice is better than thin rice porridge.

(4) Techniques to keep the mouth moist.

For example, you can rinse your mouth or chew on small ice cubes, cool chewing gum, or lemon slices to quench thirst.

(5) Place the daily fluid intake in a bottle to effectively manage fluid consumption.

(6) Drink warm plain water, in doses of 15–30 c.c. at a time.

· Be mindful of hidden water content in foods, such as lotus root, aiyu, and jelly, which have high water content and should be consumed in moderation.
