# Sports Nutrition Principles

## Before Exercise

➢ Supplement appropriate hydration, and consume low-fiber, water-rich, potassium-containing fruits to slowly release carbohydrates. Key points for hydration

➢ For exercises lasting less than one hour (e.g., running), just drink water before, during, and after exercise—no need to deliberately consume sports drinks.

➢ For competitions or high-intensity exercises lasting over one hour, salt supplementation is needed; sports drinks can be consumed in appropriate amounts.

➢ You can prepare your own sports drink to maintain energy and prevent symptoms such as dizziness, dehydration, and cramps during competitions or high-intensity workouts.

➢ Recommended ratio for homemade sports drink: 1 liter of water + 80g sugar + 3.5g salt.
