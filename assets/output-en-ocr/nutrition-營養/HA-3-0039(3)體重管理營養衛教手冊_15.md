In Taiwan, during festive occasions, people often gather for meals together. Banquets are the most common social events we encounter, and sometimes we are unable to avoid attending them. It is advisable to communicate with a nutritionist in advance to choose appropriate portion sizes and dishes, allowing you to enjoy the banquet while maintaining a healthy weight. The following guidelines are provided as a reference.

1. General principles: First, you must become familiar with the types and portion sizes of food you can consume in each meal, and remember the dietary restrictions. Although it may be difficult to precisely control your intake at a banquet, you should avoid extreme overeating.

2. Foods high in sugar should be watched carefully:

☐ Banquets often offer various juices and carbonated drinks, which contain high levels of sugar. Try to avoid drinking these. Instead, bring your own tea or sugar-free beverages.

Foods prepared with added sugar and oil—such as sweet and sour, tomato sauce, honey sauce, vinegar-based, and salad dressings—have extremely high calorie content. Try to avoid eating them. For salads, season with salt, pepper, and a light oil-vinegar dressing instead.

☐ Choose fresh fruits instead of pudding, cakes, jellies, taro paste, oily pastries, sweet soups, etc. Canned fruits are not recommended unless they are sugar-free.

3. Foods high in fat and calories: Although these do not immediately affect blood sugar levels, they can impact weight control. At banquets, many dishes use animal fats to enhance flavor. People over 50 or those managing their weight should pay special attention.

☐ Nuts such as sesame seeds, almonds, and cashews in cold dishes are primarily composed of fat. If consumed, limit intake to one tablespoon per serving.

☐ Creamy soups are often thickened with cream, monosodium glutamate (MSG), and flour, resulting in high fat content that is difficult to separate. The fat is evenly distributed throughout the soup. To reduce calorie intake, remove the ingredients and avoid drinking the broth.

☐ Dishes with liquid sauces, especially those thickened with starch, contain large amounts of starch and fat, resulting in high calorie content. Drain the liquid before eating.

☐ Processed meat products made from ground meat, such as meatballs, shrimp balls, lion's head, ham, etc., contain high levels of animal fat. Try to eat only small amounts.

☐ Fried foods must be skinless to be consumed. This includes chicken skin, duck skin, fish skin, and fatty meat. If the skin cannot be removed, it is not recommended to eat them.

☐ Foods high in cholesterol—such as internal organs, black fish roe, crab roe—should be avoided by individuals with high blood cholesterol or cardiovascular diseases.

4. Alcohol is an essential part of banquets. It is difficult for most people to abstain completely. However, after surgery, the digestive system is more fragile, and consuming alcoholic beverages may cause gastrointestinal discomfort. It is recommended to substitute alcohol with colored teas, which are gentler on the digestive system.
