## ★ Hot Pot Dishes

Hot pot dishes offer a wide variety of ingredients, all prepared by boiling, making them a good choice for dining out during weight-loss journeys. However, there are several points to keep in mind:

**Selection of broth:** Choose lighter broths such as original broth, dried kelp and dried shiitake broth, or vegetable clear broth.

Avoid high-calorie broths such as spicy hot pot, pickled cabbage and pork hot pot, milk hot pot, sukiyaki hot pot, and lamb hot pot.

**Order of cooking:** First, remove the floating oil from the broth. Then cook leafy greens first, remove them once cooked, and then add meat. Avoid adding meat after the greens have been cooked, as the greens will absorb the fat from the broth.

When selecting meat, prioritize freshness, including fish, shellfish, and other seafood. Processed items such as egg buns, goan balls, and hot pot ingredients often contain hidden fatty meats and starches and should be avoided to prevent negative impacts on weight and blood sugar.

Hot pot beverages: 6 servings of 0.5C1P

Use low-fat condiments such as sambal sauce, peanut sauce, or sesame sauce sparingly. Instead, opt for clear soy sauce with white dipping paste, scallions, ginger, garlic, and other seasonings to keep the dish light and reduce sodium intake, which helps maintain blood pressure.

☐ Hot pot broth is delicious, but it also has the highest fat content. If you wish to drink the broth, pour it out at the beginning, or substitute it with unsweetened tea.

## ★ Fast Food

Fast food outlets are commonly found in commercial districts, and many friends often gather here for meals. Most fast food items are fried, high in calories and starch, with limited vegetable portions. However, by following a few simple principles, you can enjoy fast food while staying healthy and happy.

☐ The main dishes in fast food restaurants are typically hamburgers (2–3C), which can be consumed. However, avoid fried meats; instead, choose lean pork slices with lettuce and cheese. Ask the staff to serve a small amount of mayonnaise.

☐ Remove the outer fried skin from chicken pieces (2P) or chicken wings (1P).

☐ Pizza: 12-inch, 1 slice, 2C1P. Pizza is one of the most popular foods among Chinese people. Its main ingredients include flour, oil, cheese, and tomato sauce. It is actually quite high in calories. Regardless of size, consume no more than 3 slices, pair it with vegetables, and choose a lighter flavor.

☐ Pancake: 4C; Crêpe pastry: 2C

☐ Spaghetti: There are three types of sauces—white sauce, red sauce, and green sauce—each of which is high in calories and fat. Choose a stir-fried version such as white wine clams spaghetti (3C1P) or fresh vegetable spaghetti (3C) to reduce gastrointestinal strain.

☐ For beverages, choose zero-calorie cola, lemon water, or coffee. Alternatively, ask the counter to substitute sugar.

Triangle cake: 1C1F, McChicken, fries, baked goods, onion rings, soup, cola, milkshake, apple pie, ice cream, and frozen yogurt—all of these are high in fat and sugar and should be completely avoided.
