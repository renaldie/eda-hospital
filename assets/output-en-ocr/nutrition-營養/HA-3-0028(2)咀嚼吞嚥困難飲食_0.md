## Eight: Key points to consider when eating

**Before eating**

1. Prepare to eat with full concentration—avoid chatting or watching TV.
2. Sit upright with the chin slightly retracted.
3. Use a small spoon (about 3 cm) and eat slowly in small bites.
4. Use a small, shallow cup to control the amount of water consumed.

**During eating**

1. Eat in small bites and swallow completely before taking the next bite.
2. Swallow multiple times to avoid residue.
3. If the throat feels itchy after swallowing, clear it by coughing before swallowing again.
4. If the voice sounds wet or muffled after swallowing, clear the throat and swallow thoroughly.

**After eating**

1. Clean the mouth to maintain hygiene.
2. Maintain a seated position for 20 minutes to prevent food reflux.
