## General Principles:

Dialysis is generally divided into hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Dietary control is still necessary, but the restrictions are less strict than before dialysis.

## Hemodialysis:

### 1. Adequate Protein:

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_0_303_39_357.jpg" alt="Image" width="2%" /></div>

Consume 4–7 servings (two portions) of high biological value proteins daily, such as soy products, fish, eggs, and meat.

Limit intake of low biological value proteins, such as dried beans, nuts, and gluten-containing foods (e.g., noodles, noodle products, roasted soya, etc.).

Fluid restriction: The increase in body weight before dialysis should not exceed 5% of dry weight. Total daily fluid intake should be estimated based on the previous 24-hour urine output plus 500–700 mL of water.  
Hydration alternatives: Use limited ice cubes, chew sugar-free gum, rinse mouth with water, or use lemon slices to stimulate saliva production.

### 8. If salt restriction is required:

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_0_802_40_855.jpg" alt="Image" width="2%" /></div>

Use natural seasonings such as scallions, ginger, garlic, cinnamon, Sichuan pepper, celery, cilantro, lemon, and white vinegar to enhance flavor. Limit the use of salt and seasonings (e.g., monosodium glutamate, soy sauce, miso, sambal sauce, chili sauce, tomato sauce, fermented bean paste, vinegar, etc.). Avoid high-sodium foods such as pickled and processed foods, canned goods, instant noodles, broths, and sauces.

### 4. Phosphorus restriction

Avoid high-phosphorus foods (see appendix).  
Follow medical instructions to use phosphate binders appropriately during meals.

### 5. If potassium restriction is required:

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_570_86_621_145.jpg" alt="Image" width="3%" /></div>

Since potassium ions are water-soluble, vegetables should be blanched for 1–3 minutes, then drained and stir-fried with vegetable oil to reduce potassium content.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_572_159_625_215.jpg" alt="Image" width="3%" /></div>

Consume moderate amounts of medium- and low-potassium fruits, and avoid high-potassium foods (see appendix).

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_573_228_621_281.jpg" alt="Image" width="2%" /></div>

Avoid low-sodium salt and low-salt soy sauce (thin soy sauce), as these products replace part of sodium with potassium. Avoid broth-based dishes and soups.

### 6. Iron

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_567_359_620_418.jpg" alt="Image" width="3%" /></div>

Increase intake of iron-rich foods such as red meat, pig blood, clams, mussels, red amaranth, and red leafy greens.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_569_426_620_485.jpg" alt="Image" width="3%" /></div>

Pair iron-rich foods with vitamin C-rich foods to enhance iron absorption, such as citrus fruits and colored peppers.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_564_494_618_550.jpg" alt="Image" width="3%" /></div>

Animal-based iron-rich foods also contain high levels of phosphorus, so they should be taken with phosphate binders.

### 7. Vitamins

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_565_663_618_720.jpg" alt="Image" width="3%" /></div>

Dialysis patients often suffer from deficiencies in water-soluble vitamins due to dietary restrictions or metabolic disorders, especially B vitamins. Therefore, appropriate supplementation of B vitamins and folic acid is necessary. Folic acid also helps prevent anemia.

Persimmon may cause unexplained neurological reactions in dialysis patients.
