# Diet Principles

☑ After surgery, the stomach can only hold 100 c.c. Initially, if food intake exceeds this capacity, vomiting or discomfort will occur. In such cases, rest and avoid eating.

☑ Solid and liquid foods should be separated by 20–30 minutes to prevent gastric distension and discomfort.

☑ Eating speed: After surgery, eating should be done slowly, with small, frequent meals and thorough chewing to prevent gastric outlet obstruction, vomiting, and other complications.

☑ Adequate fluid intake is essential to prevent dehydration or constipation.

☑ If adverse reactions occur after eating, temporarily return to the previous stage of food (e.g., clear liquids or liquids) for 2–3 days before adjusting again.

☑ Post-surgical diets should increase the proportion of protein (such as beans, fish, meat, and eggs), which can accelerate weight loss and reduce the risk of binge eating.

☑ Cooking methods should primarily include minimal plant oil, steaming, boiling, stewing, braising, roasting, and cold-dressing. Choose fresh, natural foods and avoid processed, refined, or overly oily and salty foods.

◆ Patients undergoing weight-loss surgery are prone to acid reflux. Avoid spicy and sweet foods, and take anti-acid medication as prescribed. If symptoms do not improve, return to the hospital for a follow-up visit.

◆ Patients undergoing weight-loss surgery should avoid concentrated sweets (such as sugar, soda, cakes, and ice cream) to prevent binge eating.

After any surgery, avoid high-fat and sweet, greasy foods to prevent weight gain and physical discomfort.

In the first two weeks, due to reduced food intake, dizziness may occur. During the first month, due to adaptation to new food intake, occasional burping or vomiting may happen. Closely follow dietary guidance from your doctor and nutritionist to alleviate discomfort.

Post-surgery, regular blood tests are required, and comprehensive vitamins and minerals should be supplemented as prescribed. Do not adjust dosage without medical advice.

☑ The most significant weight loss occurs in the first six months after surgery, with reduced effectiveness gradually observed after one year. The gastric pouch is elastic and will gradually expand, leading to increased food intake. Therefore, take advantage of this golden period and strictly follow professional dietary guidance to achieve the ideal body weight as quickly as possible.
