## What is chronic kidney disease?

When kidney function is impaired and remains abnormal for more than three months without recovery, it indicates that one has entered the stage of chronic kidney disease. This signifies irreversible damage to the kidneys. If this condition is ignored or if inappropriate dietary habits, unverified folk remedies, or medications with nephrotoxicity are continued, the already damaged kidneys may suffer further deterioration and quickly progress to end-stage kidney disease (uremia). At this stage, dialysis or kidney transplantation will be required to replace the damaged kidneys.

If you understand your kidneys and take steps to protect them through proper diet and medication, you can delay the progression to end-stage kidney disease and reduce the risk of complications and uncomfortable symptoms.

In the early stages of kidney disease, there are usually no obvious symptoms, making it difficult to detect. By the time symptoms become noticeable, the condition may have already progressed to stages 4 or 5. In end-stage kidney disease, symptoms of general discomfort are more common.
