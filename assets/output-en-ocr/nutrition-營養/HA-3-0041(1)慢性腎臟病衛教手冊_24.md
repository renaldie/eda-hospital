## Comparison between Peritoneal Dialysis and Hemodialysis

| Property | Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) | Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD) | Hemodialysis (HD) |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Treatment Provider | Patient or family member | Patient or family member | Medical personnel |
| Dialysis Access | Peritoneal dialysis catheter | Peritoneal dialysis catheter | Arteriovenous fistula |
| Dialysis Method | Insert needle, inject dialysate through catheter, leave dialysate in peritoneal cavity for 4–6 hours to purify blood, then drain the dialysate and inject fresh dialysate. This is known as one exchange. | Insert needle, connect and disconnect once daily, with automated peritoneal dialysis machine (APD) performing the injection and drainage of dialysate to complete treatment. | Each session requires inserting two needles into the arteriovenous fistula: one end draws blood out of the body for purification, and the other returns the purified blood back into the body. |
| Duration of Treatment | Perform 4–5 exchanges daily, each exchange takes about 20–30 minutes; continuous dialysis throughout 24 hours | Exchange performed by automated peritoneal dialysis machine (APD) during nighttime sleep/rest periods | Three sessions per week, each session lasting 4–5 hours |
| Treatment Schedule | Flexible, adjustable according to personal routine | Performed during nighttime sleep/rest periods | Follows fixed schedule arranged by the hospital |
| Treatment Location | At home, workplace, or any clean place | At home, workplace, or any clean place | Hospital hemodialysis room |
| Maintenance of Residual Kidney Function | Residual kidney function maintained for a longer period | Residual kidney function maintained for a longer period | Residual kidney function lost more quickly |
| Rate of Fluid and Toxin Clearance and Changes in Blood Biochemistry | Slower clearance rate, stable changes in blood biochemistry | Slower clearance rate, stable changes in blood biochemistry | Faster clearance rate, but significant fluctuations in blood biochemistry |
| Diet | No restrictions on potassium or fluid (except in severe hypertension and edema), moderate salt intake recommended, encourage high protein intake (1–1.2 gm/kg) | No restrictions on potassium or fluid (except in severe hypertension and edema), moderate salt intake recommended, encourage high protein intake (1–1.2 gm/kg) | Limited in potassium, fluid, and protein (0.8–1.0 gm/kg), no special restriction on salt intake (except for diabetics) |
| Blood Pressure Control | Continuous fluid removal, blood pressure easier to control | Continuous fluid removal, blood pressure easier to control | Limited in potassium, fluid, and protein (0.8–1.0 gm/kg), no special restriction on salt intake (except for diabetics) |
| Anemia Level | No blood loss, milder anemia | No blood loss, milder anemia | Only dialyzed every two days; blood pressure is high before dialysis but drops after dialysis |
| Complications During Treatment | No needle insertion required; due to steady removal of fluid and toxins, no dialysis disequilibrium syndrome occurs | No needle insertion required; due to steady removal of fluid and toxins, no dialysis disequilibrium syndrome occurs | Due to potential blood loss, complications are more severe |
| Quality of Life During Treatment (Impact of dialysis on daily life) | Patient performs peritoneal dialysis independently, adjusts schedule according to personal routine, helps maintain original quality of life | Nighttime APD performs peritoneal dialysis, minimal impact on daily life, helps maintain original quality of life | Painful needle insertion; due to rapid removal of fluid and toxins, more prone to dialysis disequilibrium syndrome (headache, nausea, vomiting, hearing disturbances, hypertension or hypotension) |
