DASH Diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) encourages the consumption of large amounts of fresh vegetables and fruits, and foods rich in potassium, calcium, and magnesium, to help control blood pressure and reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.

## Dietary Principles

## Whole Grains and Cereals: 6–8 servings  
Choose whole, unprocessed foods to replace white rice, noodles, and bread, such as brown rice, oats, buckwheat, quinoa, sweet potatoes, red beans, green beans, whole wheat bread, etc.

## Vegetables: 4–5 servings  
Each serving is approximately 100 grams of edible raw weight or about half a bowl when cooked. Diversify in types and colors. If purchasing frozen vegetables, avoid adding extra oil or excessive seasoning.

## Fruits: 4–5 servings  
Approximately one bowl when sliced or as described, with diverse types and colors. Individuals with diabetes or abnormal blood sugar levels are advised to limit intake to 2 servings per day.

Choose low-fat milk, low-fat cheese slices, unsweetened yogurt, and cheese. Shortening and cream are high-fat foods and are not suitable for this diet!

Walnuts, cashews, pumpkin seeds, almonds, sesame seeds, chia seeds, flaxseeds, and pistachios.  
※ Each serving of nuts is approximately 1–2 tablespoons. Consume in moderation to avoid excessive calorie intake.

## Lean meats, poultry, and seafood: ≤6 servings  
Limit saturated fat intake. Choose skinless chicken breast, skinless chicken legs, fish, shrimp, squid, salmon, tuna, mackerel, sardines, edamame, tofu, bean curd, bean buns, and soy milk. Reduce consumption of red meat.

## Sugary foods: less than 5 times per week

Each serving of sweet food contains about 15 grams of sugar. It is recommended to substitute with fruits, dairy products, or sugar-free or low-sugar foods.

## Fats and oils: 2–3 servings  
Choose healthy fat sources and appropriate cooking methods, and avoid high-temperature cooking.  
- Oils rich in monounsaturated fats (Omega-9), such as olive oil, rapeseed oil, and avocado oil;  
- Oils rich in polyunsaturated fats (Omega-6), such as grape seed oil, sunflower oil, soybean oil, and peanut oil;  
- Oils with higher Omega-3 content, such as flaxseed oil.

1. Fruits and vegetables are rich in potassium, which is water-soluble. Avoid soaking food in water for long periods. It is recommended to wash vegetables and fruits before cutting them. When cooking, use minimal water and retain some cooking liquid to reduce potassium ion loss during food preparation.

2. Many commercially available low-sodium seasonings use potassium instead of sodium. Replace regular salt with low-sodium salt, light salt, or salt-free soy sauce. Individuals with kidney dysfunction should not use low-sodium salt and should consult a doctor or nutritionist.

3. The following conditions are not suitable for the DASH diet. Please consult a doctor or nutritionist:

(1) Blood potassium level exceeds 5.0 mg/dL.  
(2) Certain cases of kidney failure or adrenal insufficiency.  
(3) Individuals taking certain medications that may raise blood potassium levels, such as spironolactone or triamterene.  
(4) Oral potassium supplements.  
(5) Kidney failure or dialysis treatment.

4. Cooking methods should include boiling, steaming, braising, or roasting. Avoid frying, deep-frying, or excessive use of seasonings.

5. Carefully read food labels to improve food selection when eating out.

6. Moderately limit sodium intake to ≤2300 mg per day.

7. Avoid drinking long-simmered broths and do not mix vegetable or meat juices into dishes.
