## Fasting Blood Glucose Glucose AC (normal range: 70–100 mg/dl):

It is the glucose concentration in the blood after an 8-hour fast, and can serve as the most basic screening method for diabetes.

## Sodium Na (normal range: 136–145 mEq/L):

Sodium ions are essential for maintaining the stability of body fluids (water balance). Severe dehydration or excessive sodium intake can lead to elevated blood sodium levels; conversely, in patients with renal failure who suffer from diarrhea or vomiting, blood sodium levels may decrease. Both excessively high and low sodium levels can disrupt the accumulation and distribution of body fluids.

#### Potassium K (normal range: 3.5–5.1 mEq/L):

Potassium ions play a role in stimulating nerve and muscle activity. Low blood potassium can cause generalized weakness and fatigue, while high blood potassium may lead to arrhythmias, even cardiac arrest. In patients with renal disease, as kidney function declines, potassium excretion decreases, increasing the risk of hyperkalemia. However, in cases of severe vomiting, diarrhea, overly restrictive diet, or use of diuretics, hypokalemia may occur.

#### Calcium Ca (normal range: 8.8–10.2 mg/dl):

In the human body, 99% of calcium is stored in bones in the form of calcium phosphate, with only 1% present in the blood. However, this 1% of blood calcium is crucial for maintaining stable nerve and muscle function. Patients with chronic renal failure are prone to hypocalcemia due to deficiency of active vitamin D, hyperphosphatemia, and malnutrition.

#### Phosphorus P (normal range: 2.7–4.5 mg/dl):

Phosphorus and calcium exist in the body in a balanced state. When renal function declines, phosphorus cannot be fully excreted by the kidneys and accumulates in the body, leading to calcium-phosphorus imbalance. Over time, this stimulates the secretion of parathyroid hormone, creating a vicious cycle that may eventually result in secondary hyperparathyroidism.
