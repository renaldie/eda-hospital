## If potassium intake needs to be limited:

Patients with kidney failure have reduced ability to excrete potassium ions. When blood potassium levels are elevated or when daily urine output is less than 1000 c.c., there is an increased risk of hyperkalemia, and potassium intake should be restricted. Potassium ions are widely present in various foods. Following the suggestions below can help reduce potassium intake:

1) Eat less high-potassium foods: such as concentrated meat broths, sports drinks, traditional Chinese medicine broths, monosodium glutamate (MSG), coffee, tea, lettuce, chocolate, high-potassium fruits (such as small tomatoes, bananas, kiwi, melon, honeydew), and various fruit juices and dried fruits.

2) Since potassium ions are water-soluble, vegetables can be blanched in boiling water (1–3 minutes) after washing and cutting, then stir-fried with vegetable oil, which can reduce potassium intake.

) Avoid using low-sodium salt or low-sodium soy sauce (thin soy sauce), as these products replace part of sodium with potassium.
