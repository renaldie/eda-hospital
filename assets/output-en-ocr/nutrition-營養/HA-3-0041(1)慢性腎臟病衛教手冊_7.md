## Chronic Kidney Disease: Testing and Clinical Significance

## Urine Protein (normal value < 150 mg/day):

Physiological proteinuria may occur in healthy individuals after exercise, before menstruation in women, or during fever. However, persistent proteinuria is often indicative of kidney disease.

## Glucosuria (normal is negative):

Glucosuria can occur in kidney disease, even when blood glucose levels remain normal—this is known as renal glucosuria. However, if blood glucose levels are elevated as well, diabetes may be suspected.

## Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) (normal value: 6–20 mg/dL):

BUN is a byproduct of protein metabolism. When kidney function is impaired, the excretion of urea nitrogen is affected, leading to elevated serum BUN levels. However, BUN levels are easily influenced by diet and medications, so diagnosis should be made in conjunction with creatinine test results.

## Creatinine

###### (men: 0.72–1.18 mg/dL, women: 0.55–1.02 mg/dL):

Creatinine is a byproduct formed from the breakdown of creatine in muscle tissue. It is not affected by food or medication, making it a more accurate marker for kidney function than BUN. However, creatinine levels vary depending on body size and muscle mass. Generally, men with more muscular build have higher creatinine values than women with smaller body frames.

#### Hemoglobin (Hb) (men: 13.5–17.5 g/dL, women: 12–16 g/dL):

Hemoglobin refers to the ratio of red blood cells in the blood. Patients with chronic kidney failure often lack erythropoietin (EPO), and the accumulation of urinary toxins accelerates red blood cell destruction, leading to anemia. Hemoglobin levels can be used to assess the severity of anemia and to guide treatment with EPO injections.

#### Albumin (normal value: 3.8–5.3 g/dL):

Albumin is a key substance that maintains plasma osmotic pressure. Renal patients often develop hypoalbuminemia due to poor appetite and low-protein diets.
