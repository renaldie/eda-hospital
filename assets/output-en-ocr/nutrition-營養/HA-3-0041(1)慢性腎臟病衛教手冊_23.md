## Peritoneal Dialysis

Commonly known as "washing the abdomen," peritoneal dialysis involves injecting dialysis fluid into the peritoneal cavity (without directly contacting abdominal organs). Waste products and excess fluids in the small blood vessels within the peritoneal cavity are removed through the peritoneal membrane and transferred into the dialysis fluid, which is then expelled from the body.

To undergo peritoneal dialysis, a surgical procedure is required to place a peritoneal dialysis catheter into the abdominal cavity. After approximately 7–10 days of wound healing, peritoneal dialysis treatment can begin.

The amount of dialysis fluid to be injected during peritoneal dialysis is determined based on body size and the patient's uremic clearance status. For adults, the typical volume injected per session is about 1500–2000 cc.

The peritoneal dialysis process involves first draining the dialysis fluid that has accumulated waste and excess fluid from the abdomen, then injecting fresh dialysis fluid. After separating the tubing, patients can resume normal activities. Each fluid exchange takes about 30 minutes, with approximately 4–5 exchanges performed per day.

Peritoneal dialysis is divided into two types: continuous peritoneal dialysis (requiring about 4–5 exchanges daily) and automated peritoneal dialysis (where the machine automatically performs fluid exchanges overnight, and exchanges are not required during the day).
