| Nutrient Components | Carbohydrates, dietary fiber, vitamins, and phytochemicals |

| Tip                 | Fruits contain carbohydrates and should be consumed in moderation. Dried fruits and fruit juices have higher sugar content and are prone to overconsumption. It is recommended to prioritize fresh fruits and choose seasonal varieties for variety. |

**Group 3: Vegetables (3–5 servings per day)**
