## Excretion of metabolic waste

Waste products generated from the digestion and absorption of food, or from metabolic activities of internal organs and muscles, are excreted from the body through the kidneys.

## Regulation of water balance

Excess water in the body is processed by the kidneys into urine and excreted. The more water you consume, the greater the urine output.

## Maintenance of electrolyte balance

The kidneys can excrete excess or reabsorb deficient electrolytes such as sodium (salt), potassium, calcium, and phosphorus, thus regulating the balance of electrolytes in the body.

## Regulation of acid-base balance

The kidneys have the ability to excrete or reabsorb acidic or alkaline substances, preventing acid or alkaline poisoning.

## Secretion of hormones

1. Secretion of renin — regulates blood pressure.  
2. Secretion of erythropoietin (EPO) — promotes red blood cell production.  
3. Activation of vitamin D — helps in the absorption of calcium and phosphorus, maintaining strong bones.
