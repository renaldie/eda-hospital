## Sarcopenia - Introduction

In healthy adults after the age of 30, muscle mass and bone density begin to decline gradually each year, affecting mobility, quality of life, cognitive function, and increasing the risk of falls and disability. In addition to aging, acute or chronic diseases, insufficient physical activity, prolonged bed rest, malnutrition, inappropriate weight loss, and imbalanced protein intake can all lead to sarcopenia or frailty.

To prevent frailty, adequate nutrition and consistent physical activity are crucial. Consuming sufficient protein, calcium, and vitamin D is especially important for muscle and bone health.

## Sarcopenia - Dietary Principles

### 1. Consume adequate energy to prevent weight loss

□ Healthy adults should consume 25–30 kcal/kg of body weight; individuals over 65 years old should consume at least 25 kcal/kg, with a daily intake of no less than 1000–1200 kcal.

☐ Long-term insufficient energy intake or inappropriate weight loss methods can lead to muscle loss, increasing the risk of sarcopenia, frailty, and fractures.

### 2. Promote muscle growth by consuming high-quality protein

☐ Healthy adults should consume 0.8–1.0 g/kg of protein; older adults should consume 1.0–1.2 g/kg. Each meal should include at least one portion of high-quality protein equivalent to one palm-sized portion to ensure sufficient nutrition and promote muscle synthesis.

☐ Choose high biological value high-quality proteins such as soy products, fish, seafood, eggs, poultry, and red meat.

☐ Consume 1.5 servings of dairy products daily, such as 360 ml of fresh milk or yogurt, 300 g of yogurt, 3 slices of cheese, or 5 tablespoons of milk powder.

☐ When food intake is limited, prioritize high-quality protein sources, followed by whole grains and vegetables.

☐ Individuals with acute or chronic diseases should seek further evaluation from a physician and a nutritionist.

### 3. Enhance bone density by consuming calcium-rich foods

☐ Animal-based calcium-rich foods: (calcium-fortified) dairy products, yogurt, cheese, small fish dried, sardines, mackerel, fish canned with bones; lactose-intolerant individuals may try fermented dairy products such as yogurt, cheese, and kefir.

☐ Plant-based calcium-rich foods: tofu, soybean curd, black sesame seeds, chia seeds, seaweed, sea moss, nori, and dark green vegetables such as spinach and amaranth.

☐ Calcium supplements may be necessary; if needed, consult a medical professional for assessment.

☐ High-fat, high-salt, and highly processed diets (such as snacks, cookies, instant noodles, and processed meats) can increase bone breakdown and calcium loss in the body.

☐ Tea, coffee, and carbonated beverages may reduce calcium absorption and should be avoided when consumed simultaneously with calcium-rich foods.

### 4. Ensure adequate vitamin D intake to aid calcium absorption

☐ Vitamin D, also known as the "sun vitamin," can be obtained through sunlight exposure, food, or supplements and helps enhance calcium absorption.

□ Expose the face and arms without sunscreen for 10 to 15 minutes daily, 3 to 4 times per week; avoid peak midday sun exposure and maintain hydration.

□ Vitamin D-rich foods are primarily animal-based, such as salmon, eggs, fish liver oil, and milk (dairy products); vegetarians can obtain it from mushrooms and black fungus.

☐ Individuals with liver or kidney dysfunction may have impaired vitamin D metabolism; it is recommended to seek professional medical evaluation and appropriate supplementation.

### 5. Maintain proper chewing and swallowing to prevent malnutrition

☐ During acute illness, aging, or poor dental health, difficulties in chewing or swallowing may reduce food and nutrient intake. Prolonged difficulties can lead to loss of appetite or refusal to eat, resulting in dehydration, weight loss, malnutrition, and sarcopenia.

□ For individuals with such issues, it is recommended to seek medical advice and choose appropriate food textures, soften solid foods appropriately, and increase the viscosity of liquid beverages.

□ Combined with suitable cooking techniques, eating aids, swallowing exercises, and oral nutritional supplements, these measures can help prevent the worsening of frailty and improve quality of life.

|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 19–50 years    | 1000 mg       | 10 μg (400 IU)    |
| 51–70 years    | 1000 mg       | 15 μg (600 IU)    |
| 71 years and above | 1000 mg     | 15 μg (600 IU)    |
