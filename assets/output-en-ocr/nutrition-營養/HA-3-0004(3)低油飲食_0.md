4. Make full use of mild seasonings  
Such as: sugar, vinegar, Sichuan pepper, eight-cornered spice, five-spice powder, galangal, garlic, tomato sauce, or thickening agents, to stimulate appetite.

5. To remove the oil from braised pork or stewed soups, place the food in the refrigerator to cool, then remove the top layer of oil before reheating and consuming.

### 1. Choose natural, unprocessed foods and avoid processed foods  
Examples: cakes, cookies, snacks, meatballs, sweet and spicy (sweet and spicy snacks), blood rice, hot pot seasonings, milk tea (milk powder), milkshakes, ice cream, etc., which often contain hidden fats.

Food selection should be balanced to ensure adequate intake of various nutrients. Include more whole grains, fruits, and skimmed milk powder to compensate for the reduced calories due to fat restriction.

Supplement fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K  
Individuals who follow a low-fat diet for a long time should take appropriate supplements.

When acute conditions such as pancreatitis, cholecystitis, diarrhea, or abnormalities in fat digestion, absorption, transport, and metabolism occur, fasting should be initiated, followed by a gradual transition from clear liquids → liquids → soft foods → regular diet.
