## One: What is chewing and swallowing difficulty?

When issues occur during the process of food moving from the mouth to the stomach, resulting in an inability to properly chew food into small pieces or to swallow food smoothly, this is known as "chewing and swallowing difficulty."

## Two: What are the impacts of chewing and swallowing difficulty?

Long-term chewing and swallowing difficulties can lead to reduced appetite and malnutrition. Additionally, food and liquids may accidentally enter the trachea and even the lungs, leading to complications such as aspiration pneumonia.

## Three: Who is prone to chewing and swallowing difficulty?

1. Brain injury → stroke, head trauma, brain tumor.  
2. Neurodegenerative diseases → Parkinson's disease, dementia.  
3. Head and neck cancer → oral cancer, tongue cancer, laryngeal cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer.  
4. Aging and frailty, and other conditions (e.g., pneumonia).

## Four: Basic dietary principles for chewing and swallowing difficulty

1. Avoid foods that are too hard, too sticky, too dry, or too large (e.g., nuts, bread, mochi, fish balls).  
2. Foods that easily break apart in the mouth, have uneven small particles, or change texture in the mouth are also likely to cause choking.  
3. Foods should be moist, soft, and easily cut with simple utensils.  
4. If liquid intake is difficult, thickeners can be used appropriately to increase viscosity and aid swallowing.  
5. Since meal intake may be reduced, it is recommended to increase snacks (small, frequent meals) to meet nutritional needs.
