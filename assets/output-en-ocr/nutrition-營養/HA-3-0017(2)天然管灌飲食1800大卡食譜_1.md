## II. Preparation Method (First clean the equipment and ingredients, then pour hot water into the food processor to cover the blades for cleaning, then discard it)

### 1. Preparation for breakfast or dinner:

1) Weigh the ingredients according to portion size and add them to the food processor. Add water to a fixed volume of 250 ml (per meal) and blend until a smooth liquid consistency is achieved.

2. Preparation for four main meals (breakfast + lunch + afternoon snack + dinner):

1) Weigh natural ingredients and powdered ingredients according to the required portion sizes.

2) Cut natural ingredients into small pieces and steam them together (green vegetables should be blanched separately until tender).

3) After steaming, add the ingredients to the food processor and mix in 200 ml of warm boiled water to create a smooth liquid consistency.

4) Add the powdered ingredients and oil gradually to the food processor, and add water to a total volume of 1200 ml. Blend again until a uniform liquid consistency is achieved.

5) Filter out the residue using the strainer and divide the mixture into four equal portions (approximately 300 ml each). Cover and place in the refrigerator for cold storage.

### 3. Preparation of snacks or fruit juice:

1) Remove the skin (and seeds) from the fruit and add 150 ml of cold boiled water (room temperature water) to the food processor. Blend thoroughly and then filter.
