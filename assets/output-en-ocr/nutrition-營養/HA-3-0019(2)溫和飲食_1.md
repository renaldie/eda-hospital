## I. Introduction

A gentle diet is a non-irritating, low-fiber, easily digestible diet that provides sufficient nutrition. It reduces the burden on the digestive system of patients with peptic ulcers or gastritis, while ensuring adequate nutritional intake.

## III. General Dietary Principles

(1) Chew food thoroughly, eat at regular times and in fixed portions, with small, frequent meals.

(2) Avoid eating only starch; it is better to combine starch with protein and fat in each meal.

(3) The diet should be nutritionally sufficient and non-irritating.

## (4) During acute gastritis:

First, fast for 1-2 days to allow the stomach to rest,  
and drink small amounts of water to prevent thirst.

(5) Peptic ulcers are divided into three stages according to the treatment protocol:

## Stage One (from bleeding to hemostasis, lasting 2-3 days):

1. Clear liquid diet.  
2. Prepare low-sugar, oil-free foods into liquid form.

✗ Stage Two (2-3 days after hemostasis to recovery period): liquid, soft foods, or gentle diet.

## Stage Three (recovery period):

At this stage, the diet is similar to a regular diet. Unless the patient feels discomfort, they should try to consume a variety of foods.
