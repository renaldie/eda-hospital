## Dietary Principles for Chronic Kidney Disease

· The following plant-based proteins have lower biological value and should be consumed in limited amounts under protein restriction:

Legumes  
soybeans, red beans, lentils, broad beans, mung beans, green bean meal  

Nuts  
peanuts, sunflower seeds, cashews, walnuts, almonds, pistachios, macadamia nuts, sesame seeds  

Gluten-based foods  
gluten, instant noodles, baked gluten, noodle wheels  

### 3. Principle of Phosphorus Restriction

Abnormal blood phosphorus levels can lead to bone and vascular lesions and may also damage kidney function. Therefore, reducing dietary phosphorus intake and decreasing phosphorus absorption are key aspects of dietary management for patients with chronic kidney disease.

For patients with high blood phosphorus levels, even reducing the intake of high-phosphorus foods may not be sufficient to maintain normal blood phosphorus levels. Thus, phosphorus binders (calcium supplements) should be taken during meals to reduce phosphorus absorption from food and help lower blood phosphorus levels.

For patients with low blood phosphorus, which may be related to malnutrition or treatment, consultation with a physician and a dietitian is recommended.
