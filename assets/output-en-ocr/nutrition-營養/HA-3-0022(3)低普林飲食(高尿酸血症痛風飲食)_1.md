## Low purine diet (diet for hyperuricemia/gout)

## Dietary principles

1. The "purine" in food is broken down into "purine" during digestion, which is then metabolized by the liver into "uric acid," and finally excreted by the kidneys. Approximately 85% of uric acid in the body is produced internally. Therefore, in addition to maintaining a balanced intake of the six major food groups and limiting high-purine foods, patients with hyperuricemia/gout should also take medication as prescribed and maintain a healthy body weight.

2. Patients with hyperuricemia/gout should avoid excessive seasoning, as rapid tissue breakdown may lead to a large amount of uric acid and keto acids, triggering acute attacks and worsening gout symptoms.

3. Excessive protein intake increases purine synthesis. Therefore, protein intake should be avoided, with a recommended intake of 1 gram of protein per kilogram of body weight per day.

1. Soya and its products (such as tofu, bean curd, soy milk, etc.) contain different types of purine compared to meat. Therefore, during non-acute phases, they can still be consumed in moderation. Consuming tofu has been shown to alter plasma protein concentration and increase uric acid clearance and excretion.

During non-acute episodes, high-purine foods should still be limited. Moderate intake of medium-purine foods is acceptable, and dry beans should be consumed as little as possible. Daily intake should primarily focus on low-purine foods.

During acute episodes, protein should ideally come solely from egg, milk, or dairy products. Patients should also prefer low-purine foods and refer to the food selection table (Table 1). High-fat diets inhibit uric acid excretion. Therefore, cooking fats should be used in moderation, and fried or pan-fried foods should be avoided. Plant-based oils should be preferred.

8. Avoid consuming meat broth or meat juice (as long-cooked meat broth or meat juice often contains large amounts of released purine).

9. Alcohol and fruit-containing beverages should be avoided as much as possible. Alcohol metabolism produces lactic acid, which affects uric acid excretion.

10. Patients should drink plenty of water to aid uric acid excretion. It is recommended to consume 3,000 milliliters of liquid daily.

11. Cocoa, coffee, and tea metabolites do not accumulate in body tissues. Moderate consumption can increase fluid intake and accelerate uric acid excretion.
