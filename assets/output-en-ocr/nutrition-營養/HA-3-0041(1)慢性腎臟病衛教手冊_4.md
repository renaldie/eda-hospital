## ☑ High-risk groups for chronic kidney disease

· Diabetes

· Drug abusers: long-term use of anti-inflammatory pain relievers (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), unverified herbal remedies, and folk cures  

## Chronic kidney disease is classified into 5 stages based on disease progression  

(Chronic kidney disease in stages 1 and 2 has relatively normal kidney function, so proteinuria must be present for diagnosis!)

| Stage | Disease Progression | eGFR (normal range: 100–125 cc/min) |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Stage 1 | Normal kidney function<br>Presence of proteinuria | ≥90 |
| Stage 2 | Mild chronic kidney failure<br>Presence of proteinuria | 60–89 |
| Stage 3 | Moderate chronic kidney failure | 30–59 |
| Stage 4 | Severe chronic kidney failure | 15–29 |
| Stage 5 | End-stage kidney disease | <15 |
