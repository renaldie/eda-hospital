## General Principles:

Consume adequate calories: If there are no other diseases limiting dietary intake, cooking methods such as frying in oil, deep-frying, or thickening with a slurry can be used to increase caloric intake.

It is recommended that 50% of protein needs come from high biological value proteins, such as fish, eggs, meat, and soy products, while the remaining portion should be supplied by whole grains, cereals, and vegetables.

Under conditions of restricted protein intake, reduce consumption of low biological value protein foods, such as dried beans (green beans, red beans, broad beans, pea beans, fava beans, mung beans, etc.), nuts (peanuts, sunflower seeds, cashews, walnuts, sesame seeds, almonds, etc.) and gluten-based foods (gluten, instant noodles, roasted gluten, etc.).

Replace staple foods or supplement calories with low-protein, low-nitrogen starches (which are transparent when cooked), such as board strips, rice vermicelli, sweet potatoes, carrot cakes, tapioca, sweet potato flour, gelatin flour, lotus root flour, winter noodles, rice noodles, western rice, and rice balls. These can be stir-fried with vegetable oil. If there is no issue with glucose metabolism, a small amount of sugar, rock sugar, or honey can also be added to increase caloric intake.

Prohibition: Do not consume bitter melon, as it contains a certain neurotoxin that the kidneys cannot eliminate, which may lead to neurotoxicity.

Follow the adjustments for electrolytes (sodium, phosphorus, potassium).

## If water intake needs to be restricted:

(1) The daily fluid intake (drinking water, beverages, soups, fruits, food, medicine) can be estimated by adding 500–700 mL of water to the previous 24-hour urine output.

(2) Methods to quench thirst include limited ice consumption, chewing sugar-free candies, rinsing the mouth with water, or using lemon slices to stimulate saliva secretion.

## If salt intake needs to be restricted:

(1) Avoid high-sodium foods such as preserved and processed foods, canned goods, instant noodles, broths, sauces, etc. Use salt and seasonings (monosodium glutamate, soy sauce, miso, sambal sauce, chili sauce, tomato sauce, fermented bean paste, vinegar, etc.) in limited quantities.

(2) Use natural aromatic spices such as scallions, leeks, garlic, five-spice powder, cinnamon, Sichuan pepper, celery, coriander, lemon, and white vinegar to enhance food flavor.

## If phosphorus intake needs to be restricted:

For patients with impaired kidney function, early and appropriate restriction of dietary phosphorus can delay the progression of kidney dysfunction and prevent the development of renal bone disease. Even when blood phosphorus levels are normal, high-phosphorus foods should still be avoided.

(1) Avoid high-phosphorus foods such as organs, dried beans, nuts, whole grains, eggs, yeast, dairy products, and avoid consuming meat broth, meat paste, and processed foods.

(2) Take phosphorus binders as prescribed by a doctor during meals.
