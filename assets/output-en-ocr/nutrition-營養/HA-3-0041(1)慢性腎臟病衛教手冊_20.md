## Moderate exercise:

Developing the habit of moderate physical activity—such as walking, cycling, or practicing stretching exercises—for 10 to 15 minutes each day can not only improve anemia but also help in managing body weight and blood pressure.

## Proper kidney care:

· Maintain a regular sleep schedule, avoid smoking and alcohol consumption.

Do not take unverified folk remedies or traditional Chinese or herbal medicines without guidance.

When visiting a doctor, inform the physician of your chronic kidney disease and avoid self-medicating with painkillers, antibiotics, or over-the-counter medications.

Follow the recommendations of a nephrologist for regular follow-up visits, and discuss treatment plans with your doctor, nurse educator, and dietitian.

• For diabetic patients, keep fasting blood glucose levels below 125 mg/dl. HbA1C should be below 7%.
