By adjusting lifestyle and dietary habits, maintaining an ideal body weight, and combining appropriate medication to control blood glucose within a reasonable range, the risk of diabetes-related complications can be prevented or reduced.

1. Eat regular and measured portions: Maintain consistent meal sizes to avoid large or small meals, and eat at proper times to keep blood glucose stable.

2. Maintain an ideal body weight: Obesity increases insulin resistance; reducing body weight by 5–7% can help improve glucose control.

3. Balanced intake of six major food groups:

## 【Vegetable group】Vegetables should be consumed in greater quantity than fruits

Leafy greens, corn shoot, black fungus, yellow light vegetable, radish, bamboo shoot, bell pepper, large tomato, mushrooms, gourds

## 【Whole grains and coarse grains】Grains should be consumed in the same amount as vegetables

Rice, buns, noodles,  
oatmeal, pumpkin, sweet potato,  
corn, red beans, lotus root,  
pea meal, soybean paste, etc.

## 【Fruit group】Two fruit bowls per day

Fresh fruits such as oranges, bananas, papaya, small tomatoes, etc.

【Fat and seed group】One teaspoon of seeds per day

Nuts such as peanuts, cashews, pumpkin seeds, etc.

## 【Legumes, fish, eggs, and meat group】One palm-sized portion of legumes, fish, eggs, and meat

Soymilk and its products, black beans, broad beans, seafood, eggs, chicken, duck, beef, mutton, pork

## 【Dairy group】

## One cup (portion) of milk in the morning and evening daily

Fresh milk, cheese, yogurt, kefir, etc.

. Increase dietary fiber intake: Prevents rapid postprandial blood glucose spikes, enhances satiety, and improves constipation.

5. Low-fat cooking: Steaming, boiling, pickling, stewing, roasting, or涮 (hot pot).

### 6. Reduce intake of saturated and trans fats:

· Avoid fatty meats, pork skin, duck skin, chicken skin, fish skin, five-layer pork, chicken wings, fish belly, fish head, etc.

· Avoid fried, pan-fried, deep-fried, thickened sauces, concentrated soups, laksa, pesto, béchamel, custard, Thousand Island sauce, cream, and milk foam.

· Avoid trans fats: Hydrogenated vegetable oils, oils heated at high temperatures, and repeatedly fried foods.

· Reduce processed foods: sausages, bacon, buns, hot pot seasonings, etc.

7. Limit intake of high-cholesterol foods: internal organs, shrimp paste, crab roe, shrimp eggs, fish eggs, milk powder, cream balls, etc.

8. Limit alcohol consumption: Men ≤ 2 alcohol units; women ≤ 1 alcohol unit.

※1 alcohol unit = 250 ml of 5% beer = 30 ml of 40% whisky = 22 ml of 58% rice wine

9. Limit intake of refined sugars: sugary drinks, soda, fruit juice, cakes, birthday cakes, bread, cookies, etc.

※For those who enjoy sweet foods, low-calorie sweeteners (non-nutritive sweeteners) such as lo han guo sugar, inulin, aspartame, saccharin, potassium acetosulfate, etc., can be used.
