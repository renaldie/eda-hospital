## Dietary Principles for Chronic Kidney Disease

## Objective:

When the kidneys become diseased, they are unable to excrete nitrogenous waste from the body, leading to an accumulation of nitrogenous waste in the blood. In severe cases, this can cause imbalances in body electrolytes. Therefore, dietary treatment for kidney disease must be adjusted according to the progression of the condition to correct imbalances in body water, acid-base balance, and electrolytes, maintain appropriate nutritional status, and reduce the risk of complications.

## Dietary Principles:

### 1. Maintain Adequate Caloric Intake

The principle should be to maintain ideal body weight. While controlling protein intake, sufficient caloric intake must also be ensured.

- When caloric intake is adequate, ingested protein can be utilized most efficiently, resulting in minimal production of uremic toxins.
- Inadequate caloric intake often leads to tissue breakdown, increasing the production of nitrogenous waste.

### 2. Limit Protein Intake

Excessive protein intake in the diet increases renal blood flow, leading to hypertension within the glomeruli and placing additional stress on the kidneys, thereby damaging kidney function.

It is recommended that 1/2 to 2/3 of the protein intake should come from high biological value protein sources, such as eggs, pork, chicken, duck, fish, beef, and soy-based foods like tofu, soybean curd, and bean buns. High biological value proteins are efficiently utilized in the body, produce fewer uremic toxins, and help prevent muscle wasting.

· Protein restriction guidelines:

(1) For patients in the early stages of chronic kidney disease, the recommended protein intake is the same as that for healthy individuals—0.8 to 1.0 grams per kilogram of body weight.

(2) For patients in stage three or later of chronic kidney disease, protein intake should be limited to 0.6 to 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. If blood glucose levels are stable and nutritional status is good, and if further dietary control is desired, protein intake can be reduced to 0.6 grams per kilogram under the guidance of a dietitian.
