## Gastrointestinal symptoms:

Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, oral odor of urine, gastrointestinal bleeding, constipation, and diarrhea.

## Hematological symptoms:

Anemia, easy bleeding (such as nosebleeds, gingival bleeding, skin bruising), weakened immunity, and increased susceptibility to infection.

## Endocrine and metabolic symptoms:

Decreased sexual function, elevated lipid levels, hyperparathyroidism, and impaired glucose tolerance.

## Skin, muscle, and skeletal symptoms:
