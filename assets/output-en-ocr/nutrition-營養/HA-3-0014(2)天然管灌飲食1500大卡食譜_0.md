## Five. Other Notes

1. A dietitian can design a suitable meal plan based on individual needs to achieve appropriate nutrient composition.

2. During preparation, ensure good hygiene practices and cleanliness of feeding utensils. Before feeding, thoroughly wash hands and feeding equipment, and disinfect all feeding tools. Freshly prepared and portioned meals should be stored in the refrigerator and consumed within 24 hours to avoid contamination.

3. Before each feeding, take out an appropriate amount and gently heat it to body temperature (approximately 37°C), stir well, and then administer it.

4. The formula should not be left at room temperature for more than 30 minutes. If feeding cannot be immediately carried out, store it in the refrigerator. Medications should not be directly added to the formula, as this may cause spoilage or affect the medication's efficacy.

5. Before each feeding, check the residual volume in the stomach to assess digestion. If the residual volume is large (>60 ml), pause feeding for 1–2 hours, then recheck the residual volume to evaluate digestive status.

6. Avoid using lard or beef tallow to prevent solidification upon cooling, which may cause blockage in the feeding tube.
