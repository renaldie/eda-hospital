● 3 sugar cubes  
● Half a cup (120 mL) of juice or sugary soft drink or beverage  
● 1 teaspoon of sugar or honey  

◇ If blood glucose is below 50 mg/dL, consume 15 grams of carbohydrates = 2 servings of carbohydrate food  

☐ Recheck blood glucose after 15–20 minutes. If the level remains ≤70 mg/dL, consume another 15 grams of carbohydrate food. If the glucose level still does not return to the normal range, seek medical attention immediately.
