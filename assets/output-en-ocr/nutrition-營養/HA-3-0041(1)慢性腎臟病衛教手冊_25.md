Commonly known as "kidney exchange," kidney transplantation involves implanting a donor's kidney into a recipient to replace the damaged kidney and continue normal function.

The procedure is performed through surgery, during which the donor's kidney and ureter are implanted into the recipient's pelvis and connected to the bladder wall. In Taiwan, sources of donated kidneys are divided into living donor transplantation and deceased donor transplantation.

• Living donor transplantation: Limited to first-degree relatives (five-degree relatives) of the recipient. In addition to verifying tissue compatibility between donor and recipient, the donor's kidney function and renal vascular function must also be evaluated. Generally, the survival rate of kidneys from living donors is higher than that from deceased donors.

• Deceased donor transplantation: Recipients who wish to undergo deceased donor transplantation must first complete kidney transplantation registration at a hospital and submit various medical reports. When a suitable kidney becomes available, the recipient who meets the criteria and has the best tissue match will undergo transplantation at the registered hospital.
