## Should cancer patients reduce meat intake, even adopting a vegetarian or raw food diet?

Incorrect! During treatment, sufficient calories and protein are needed to support tissue repair, reconstruction, and immune function regulation. Therefore, it is recommended to maintain a balanced diet and choose high-quality proteins such as soy products (tofu, soy milk), eggs, fish, seafood, poultry and red meats, dairy products, and avoid raw foods to prevent infection risks.
