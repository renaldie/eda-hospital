## Low iodine diet

Iodine is a raw material for thyroid hormone production, primarily obtained from food. The recommended daily intake for adults is 150 micrograms (μg). A low-iodine diet is based on a balanced diet and involves reducing consumption of iodine-rich foods to slow down the deterioration of thyroid function.

1. Applicable populations: Patients with autoimmune thyroid diseases and certain types of thyroid cancer.

2. Applicable timing: Daily routine

3. Dietary principles

Taiwan's public health policy previously added iodine to table salt, as salt is a staple in daily diets and this method ensures most people receive sufficient iodine to address iodine deficiency-related health issues. Nowadays, people are increasingly using imported salt without added iodine, and Taiwan's iodized salt policy has gradually shifted from mandatory to advisory. Additionally, although sea salt production does not add iodine, seawater naturally contains minerals, so sea salt still contains trace amounts of iodine. Rock salt, formed from ancient ocean evaporation and subjected to long-term geological processes, contains extremely minimal natural iodine. Therefore, individuals should, according to their treatment needs, reduce intake of high-iodine foods and still choose appropriate seasonings, using them in moderation.

● Avoid: cured meats, ham, meat canned products, pickled eggs, fish, shellfish, shrimp, crab, seafood products, pickled vegetables, preserved vegetables, kelp, nori, hair cells, iodized salt, iodine-containing vitamins and nutritional supplements, candies and jellies with red coloring agents, and nutritional supplements derived from marine sources (such as shark cartilage extract).

For example, 1 gram of regular table salt contains approximately 20–50 μg of iodine. If 6 grams of salt are consumed, the iodine intake would be about 120–300 μg.

● 1 teaspoon of salt = 6 teaspoons of vinegar = 6 teaspoons of monosodium glutamate (5g) = 2 and 2/5 tablespoons of soy sauce = 15 teaspoons of tomato sauce. It is recommended to use natural ingredients to enhance flavor through cooking or to choose non-iodized salt.
