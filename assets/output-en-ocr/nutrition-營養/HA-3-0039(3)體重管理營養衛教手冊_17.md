## ★ Western Cuisine

In addition to fast food outlets, various small and large Western restaurants offer diverse dining choices for the local population. During festivals, these restaurants often become highly sought-after. Below are several dining principles to help you enjoy meals without stress or physical burden.

☐ Soups: Western soups are generally divided into clear soups and rich soups. Prefer clear soups over rich ones to reduce caloric intake.

Bread: A small bun (1C) or a French bread with a small amount of condiment can serve as a main food source. Roasted potatoes and roasted corn are also acceptable. However, garlic bread (1C) and baked potatoes (1C) are less suitable.

Salads: Fresh vegetable salads such as small yellow cucumbers, tomatoes, and asparagus are excellent choices. Salad dressings high in oil should be avoided; instead, use oil and vinegar or Japanese soy sauce.

☐ Meat: 1 ounce = 1 portion (1P). Western meat dishes are typically served as plated meals, available in iron-plate or clay-plate styles. Prefer clay-plate meals, as they contain less cream and are best cooked by roasting. Fried dishes such as German pork feet should be consumed sparingly. Use rose salt or sea salt instead of steak sauce. Iron-plate steak with rice absorbs a lot of oil—consume in small portions.

☐ Desserts: After meals, choose fresh fruit or tea jelly. Western desserts such as cheese and cakes should be avoided.

☐ Beverages: Choose unsweetened or low-sugar teas or fresh fruit juice.

## ★ Japanese Cuisine

Japanese cuisine uses fresh ingredients and light cooking methods, which are widely accepted by the local population and are beneficial during weight-loss processes.

☐ Sashimi: 3–4 pieces per portion (1P), typically consisting of fish or seafood seasoned with wasabi and soy sauce. With no added fats, it offers a refreshing taste. However, be cautious about the source of the ingredients to avoid food poisoning.

☐ Sushi:  
- Hand-pressed sushi (3 pieces = 1C = 1P)  
- Small flower sushi (3 pieces = 1C)  
- Large flower sushi (2 pieces = 1C)  
- Small sushi (5 pieces = 1C)

☐ Hand rolls: Using seaweed with various vegetables and no salad sauce is a healthy and good food option.

☐ Fried foods: Fried shrimp (1 piece = 1P) can be consumed by removing the outer crispy skin and dipping in soy sauce. Fried vegetables such as fried eggplant and fried corn笋 contain extremely high oil content and should be avoided.

◇ Grilled foods: Salt-grilled items are preferable. Avoid consuming large amounts of meat that has been marinated with sauces or sugar.

☐ Okonomiyaki (large plate): 3C = 1P; Squid balls (small): 3 pieces = 1C = 1P

☐ Tea bowl steamed rice (1 bowl = 1P) and miso soup have a refreshing taste. However, miso soup has high sodium content, so individuals with unstable blood pressure should consume it with caution.

☐ Rice dishes: When eating curried rice, children's rice bowl, or beef rice bowl, separate the sauce from the rice to reduce the intake of oil from the thickened sauce.

☐ Noodles: For pot noodles, choose udon (3C = 2P), ramen (3C = 2P), or winter noodles (2C = 2P). Noodles such as difficult silk noodles and egg noodles are fried and should be avoided. Ask the restaurant to replace the hot pot ingredients with fresh vegetables or meat slices, pair with a plain broth, and avoid adding doubanjiang (fermented bean paste).
