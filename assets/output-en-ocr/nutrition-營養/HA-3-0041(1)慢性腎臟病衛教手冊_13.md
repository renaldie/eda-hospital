## ☑ Dietary Principles for Chronic Kidney Disease

### 4. Principle of Limiting "Potassium" Intake

Chronic kidney disease patients are more prone to hyperkalemia when their urine output is less than 1000 ml. If blood tests show elevated potassium levels during the progression of kidney disease, dietary potassium intake should be restricted according to the advice of a doctor or nutritionist.

· When blood potassium levels are high, the following dietary practices can be adopted to reduce potassium intake.

| Food Category | Dietary Recommendations |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| Vegetables | · Boil for 3–5 minutes, then drain and cook or stir-fry with oil · Avoid vegetable soups, meat broths, and raw lettuce |
| Fruits | · Do not exceed 2 servings per day (approximately the size of two baseballs) · Avoid high-potassium fruits (refer to potassium content table for fruits) |
| Soups | · Both vegetable and meat soups contain high levels of potassium · Avoid concentrated soups, thickened dishes, and meals seasoned with meat broth |
| Beverages | · Avoid fruit juices, coffee, monosodium glutamate (MSG), ginseng extract, and sports drinks · Plain boiled water is the best choice |
| Seasoning | · Do not use low-sodium salts, health-enhancing salts, light salts, or salt-free soy sauce that replace sodium with potassium · Use regular table salt instead |
| Other Foods | · Nuts, chocolate, plum juice, tomato sauce, golden citron sauce, dried fruits, and traditional Chinese herbal soups all have high potassium content and should be consumed with caution |

Fruit Restrictions: Avoid consuming bitter melon and its products, as they contain an unidentified neurotoxin. Many chronic kidney disease patients who consume them may experience severe symptoms such as excessive belching, numbness in limbs, and mental disturbances, and in severe cases, death may occur.
