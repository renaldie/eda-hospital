## Ultra-low iodine diet

1. Definition: The ultra-low iodine diet, based on a balanced diet, limits daily iodine intake to 50 micrograms (μg) or less, reduces iodine stored in the body, and helps improve the absorption capacity of radioactive iodine used for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes.

2. Applicable population: Patients with thyroid cancer who are undergoing radioactive iodine testing or therapy.

3. Timing: The ultra-low iodine diet is a short-term dietary approach that should be adopted approximately two weeks before and during radioactive iodine therapy. This helps enhance the uptake of iodine-131 by thyroid tumor cells.

### 4. Dietary principles

Taiwan's public health policy previously added iodine to table salt, as salt is a staple in daily diets and this method ensures most people receive sufficient iodine to address iodine deficiency-related health issues. Nowadays, with increasing use of imported non-iodized salt, Taiwan's iodized salt policy has gradually shifted from mandatory to advisory. Additionally, although sea salt production does not add iodine, seawater naturally contains minerals, so sea salt still contains trace amounts of iodine. Rock salt, formed from ancient ocean evaporation and subjected to long-term geological processes, contains naturally occurring iodine in extremely minimal amounts. During radioactive iodine therapy, please use "iodine-free salt."

● Avoid seafood (fish, shellfish, shrimp, crabs), dairy products, and related processed foods.

Prioritize natural, unprocessed foods and avoid processed foods to prevent accidental ingestion of hidden iodine additives.

● Avoid using common table salt, iodized salt, sea salt, soy sauce, vinegar, salted seasonings (such as pepper salt), kelp-based concentrated seasonings, and cooking rice wine. Instead, use iodine-free salt, white vinegar, or unsalted seasonings.

 1 gram of table salt contains approximately 20–50 micrograms (μg) of iodine. Most processed foods and seasonings contain salt components. Therefore, choose "iodine-free salt" or use natural ingredients such as green onions, ginger, garlic, and cooking oil for stir-frying, or prepare homemade fresh, naturally sweet, and flavorful broths using ingredients like white radish, corn, onions, and tomatoes.
