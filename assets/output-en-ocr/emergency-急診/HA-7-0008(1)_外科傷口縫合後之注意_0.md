## Post-surgical wound care precautions

1. Swelling at the injury site will continue for 8–12 hours after injury. Elevate the injured area and apply ice.

(1) Place an appropriate amount of ice in a cold pack, filling it with one-third water.

(2) Invert the cold pack to check for leaks. Wrap the cold pack in a dry towel and apply it to the affected area.

(3) Apply ice four times daily, for 15–20 minutes each, with a rest period in between.

2. Keep the wound dressing clean and dry. The wound should not come into contact with water. If the dressing becomes wet, replace the gauze and reapply medication immediately. During bathing, cover the injured limb with a protective bag until instructed otherwise by your doctor.

3. If the laceration is located at a joint, reduce activity to prevent the wound from reopening.

4. For facial or head wounds, use topical ointments prescribed by your doctor, and take medications as prescribed.

5. Two days after surgical closure, visit the outpatient surgery clinic for a follow-up examination. The doctor will determine the appropriate time for suture removal based on the wound condition.

6. If signs of infection appear—such as redness, swelling, pain, purulent discharge, fever, or abnormal pain, high fever with chills, swelling of the affected limb leading to numbness or pallor, poor blood circulation, or purulent drainage—seek medical attention immediately.
