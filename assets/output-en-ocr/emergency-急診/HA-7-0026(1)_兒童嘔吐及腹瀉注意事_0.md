## Children's Vomiting and Diarrhea: Important Notes

Vomiting:

Temporarily withhold food for several hours. If the child is thirsty, offer small sips of water to soothe the throat, but avoid giving large amounts of water, as this may trigger a second wave of vomiting. If vomiting persists, seek medical consultation to check for dehydration or electrolyte imbalances. Intravenous fluid therapy may be required if necessary.

Diarrhea:

First, temporarily withhold food to allow the digestive system to rest. During this period, give the child the prescribed "glucose-electrolyte solution" in small, frequent sips. Avoid giving unsweetened sports drinks, as their high sugar content can worsen diarrhea. After eight hours, if diarrhea has improved, infants primarily on milk can be given half milk (same water volume, but half the milk powder), while older children can stop drinking milk and begin consuming bland foods such as rice porridge, rice and wheat porridge mixed with water, or plain rice porridge or toast—foods that are low in oil and sugar.

If diarrhea does not improve within one to three days, do not continue feeding diluted milk powder (no type of milk powder should be used long-term in diluted form). Instead, switch to specialized formula milk (such as lactose-free milk protein formulas or plant-based protein lactose-free formulas) to reduce intestinal irritation. In this case, the original milk should be completely discontinued until diarrhea improves, after which it can be gradually reintroduced.
