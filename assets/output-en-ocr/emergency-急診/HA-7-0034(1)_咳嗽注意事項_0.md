## Cough Precautions

1. When the throat feels itchy, drink warm water slowly and swallow it to avoid coughing.

2. Avoid eating cold, sweet foods or drinks; temporarily avoid citrus fruits (oranges, clementines, grapefruits, lemons).

3. Avoid exposure to cold air; wear a mask or scarf if necessary; avoid smoking and dust exposure.

4. If there is phlegm, take deep breaths to expel it (press on the abdomen or adopt the knee-to-chest position while lying down).

5. For half an hour after taking cough syrup, avoid drinking water or eating food.

6. During coughing, wear a mask to prevent spreading the condition to others.

7. Take medication as instructed by the doctor and follow up at the outpatient clinic.

8. If high fever persists, asthma occurs, there is a large amount of yellow sputum, severe dry cough, hemoptysis, or cyanosis, seek medical attention promptly.

9. If you have high fever, cough, or diarrhea, and have recently traveled abroad or had close contact with suspected SARS patients, you may have contracted severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). If symptoms do not improve effectively or worsen after medical treatment, please visit the hospital immediately.
