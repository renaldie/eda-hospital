## Children's Cough Precautions

1. When the throat feels itchy, drink warm boiled water slowly and swallow it to prevent coughing.

2. Avoid eating cold foods, sweets, or drinks. Temporarily avoid citrus fruits (oranges, clementines, grapefruits, lemons).

3. Avoid exposure to cold air; wear a mask or scarf if necessary. Avoid secondhand smoke and dust irritation.

4. Take medication as prescribed and follow up with outpatient treatment. If there is high fever, cough, or diarrhea (with or without), especially if there is a history of recent international travel, or if symptoms do not improve effectively or worsen after seeking medical care, please seek medical attention promptly.

5. Seek medical attention immediately if there is persistent high fever, difficulty breathing, large amounts of yellow sputum, severe dry cough, hemoptysis, or cyanosis.

6. Wear a mask during coughing to prevent spreading the illness to others.
