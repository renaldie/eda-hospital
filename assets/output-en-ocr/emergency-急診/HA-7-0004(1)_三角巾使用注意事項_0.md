## Notes on the Use of Triangle Bandages

1. The triangle bandage must be clean and dry.

2. When in use, the elbow joint should be kept bent upward at an angle less than 90 degrees; the wrist and forearm should not dangle.

3. When wrapping a limb, try to expose the distal end of the limb to allow continuous observation of local blood circulation.

4. According to medical instructions, the bandage may be temporarily removed during sleep for rest.

5. If there is abnormal swelling, numbness, or altered sensation in the hand, a follow-up visit is required.
