## Important Notes on Administering Eye Drops

1. Wash your hands thoroughly before and after administering eye drops.

2. If there is a lot of discharge from the affected eye, clean the eye and eyelashes with a cotton swab (from the inner corner of the eye to the outer corner).

3. Tilt your head back. Use your left index finger to pull down the lower eyelid with your left hand, exposing the lower conjunctival sac. Hold the eye drop in your right hand and use your left forearm as a pivot point. Administer one drop—this is sufficient. If you're unsure whether the drop has entered the eye, you may administer a second drop. For eye ointment, gently squeeze a small amount from the inner corner of the eye outward into the lower conjunctival sac. Then rotate the bottle to separate the ointment. Ensure the bottle's tip does not touch the eyelashes or eyelid to avoid contamination.

4. After administering the eye drops, gently close your eyes for 5 to 10 seconds to allow the medication to distribute evenly over the eyeball. At the same time, lightly press on the inner corner of the eye for 5 to 10 seconds to close the tear ducts. This prevents the medication from flowing through the nasolacrimal duct into the nasal pharynx, which could cause discomfort, and reduces systemic absorption.

5. If both eye drops and eye ointment are being administered, first apply the eye drops, wait 5 minutes, and then apply the eye ointment.
