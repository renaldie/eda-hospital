## Ice Therapy Guidelines

1. For injuries or inflamed wounds, follow medical staff instructions.

2. Place an appropriate amount of ice cubes into an ice pack, filling it to one-third with water.

3. Invert the ice pack to check for leaks; wrap the ice pack in a dry towel, then apply it to the affected area.

4. Apply ice therapy four times daily, each session for 15~20 minutes, followed by a rest period.
