## Precautions for Lower Back Pain

1. Lie flat on your bed as much as possible to allow your lower back to rest and relax.

2. During an acute episode of lower back pain, avoid getting up on your own. It is best to ask someone else to assist you, and only get up when absolutely necessary (e.g., to use the restroom).

3. When lying flat, you can place a pillow under your knees. When sleeping on your side, place a pillow between your knees.

4. Massage or warm compresses (around 37°C, close to body temperature) can make you feel more comfortable, but be cautious to avoid burns. However, if the lower back pain is due to trauma, avoid heat application for the first two days—instead, apply cold compresses.

5. Avoid lifting or pulling heavy objects.

6. Do not use your back muscles to lift objects. When picking up something from the ground, keep your back straight, bend your knees, and squat down to pick it up.

7. Regular outpatient follow-up visits are required.

8. If you experience high fever, progressive paralysis in the lower limbs, incontinence, back pain accompanied by cold sweat, or shock, seek medical attention immediately.
