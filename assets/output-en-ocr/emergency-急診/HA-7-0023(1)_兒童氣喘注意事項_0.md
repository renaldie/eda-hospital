## Children's asthma precautions

1. To prevent attacks, please take medication as prescribed by your doctor and avoid exposure to allergens.

2. Wear a mask and scarf when there is a large temperature difference; avoid going to public places during flu season; engage in appropriate physical activity, maintain a balanced diet, and have a gentle eating habit. Carry your medication at all times for emergencies. Avoid any triggers that may cause asthma, such as tobacco smoke, smoke, pollen, cold air, dust, and dust mites.

3. If you have a persistent high fever, a cough with a large amount of yellow sputum, difficulty breathing, or if inhaler medication fails to effectively relieve symptoms, seek medical attention promptly.
