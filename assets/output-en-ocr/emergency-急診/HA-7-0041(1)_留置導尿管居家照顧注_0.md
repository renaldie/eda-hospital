## Home Care Precautions for Indwelling Catheter

1. Catheters are available in general and silicone materials. They should be used and replaced according to medical instructions, with regular changes to prevent infection, and patients should attend urology outpatient follow-ups regularly.

2. Clean the perineal area with soap water twice daily, and replace the catheter fixation site daily.

3. Drink plenty of water to increase urine output; daily urine volume should be maintained at least at 1500 cc.

4. Avoid pressure or twisting of the catheter, and gently squeeze the catheter regularly to prevent blockage.

5. The urine collection bag should be kept below the patient's waist level to prevent backflow of urine and infection. When the urine volume in the bag exceeds two-thirds, it should be emptied immediately.

6. If symptoms such as fever, chills, urethral pain, or hematuria occur, seek medical attention immediately. Eating vitamin C-rich foods (such as oranges, tangerines, tomatoes, and papaya) can help prevent urinary tract infections.

7. Carefully prevent the patient from removing the catheter themselves to avoid urethral injury.
