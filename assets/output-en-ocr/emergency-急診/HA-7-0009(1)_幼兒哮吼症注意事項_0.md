## Precautions for Croup in Children

If a child suddenly develops a hoarse voice, coughing like a dog's bark, inspiratory stridor, and difficulty breathing, this may be an episode of croup—a common condition affecting children aged one to three years. Because young children have narrower airways that are easily obstructed by mucus when inflamed, and because the inflamed vocal cords compress airflow, this results in the characteristic sound.

Croup typically occurs during winter nights. Some children suddenly develop symptoms at night, leading to poor sleep, a barking cough, hoarseness, and inspiratory stridor. Treatment includes medication, along with adequate fluid intake and exposure to cool, moist air—for example, by using bathroom steam or a facial steamer. Inhaling steam for about 15 minutes each time can naturally expand the child's airways and help relieve symptoms. If the child's breathing difficulties do not improve, immediate emergency treatment is required.
