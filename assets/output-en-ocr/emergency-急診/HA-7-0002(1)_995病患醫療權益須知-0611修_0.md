## Information on Medical Rights for Victims of Sexual Assault

1. When you visit our hospital for treatment, we will not refuse your medical needs without cause, and we will treat you as a first-level emergency injury case, prioritizing your care.

2. If our hospital's facilities or technology are unable to provide complete medical treatment, we will proactively arrange a referral service and provide you or your accompanying family members with detailed information about the name and address of the referral medical institution, so you can receive comprehensive care.

3. When you receive treatment at our hospital, a social worker or nurse will accompany you during the injury examination. If you require family members to be present, you may request that family members stay with you during the process.

4. During the injury examination and evidence collection process, we will provide a private and warm environment to avoid unnecessary disturbances.

5. All medical and evidence collection expenses incurred due to this incident will be covered by the county or city government where your household registration is located. You will not be required to pay any fees.

6. You or your spouse, or your legal guardian (if you are under 18 and unmarried, your parents are your legal guardians) may apply to our hospital to obtain an official injury diagnosis certificate.

7. To protect your rights, our hospital will assist in collecting evidence and conducting injury examinations during your treatment, which can serve as evidence for your legal complaint. During the medical examination, if the doctor needs to examine more private areas, you may express any discomfort to the medical staff, who will assist you accordingly.

8. The collection of evidence and injury examination will only proceed after your explicit consent and completion of the injury examination and evidence collection consent form. Collected evidence will be stored in sealed evidence bags and handed over to the police for further assistance. These evidences will be strictly protected and will not be disclosed to unauthorized parties.

9. If you have any questions or concerns, you may consult the National Child and Women Protection Hotline at 113. They will provide detailed explanations and ongoing support to ensure you receive appropriate assistance.
