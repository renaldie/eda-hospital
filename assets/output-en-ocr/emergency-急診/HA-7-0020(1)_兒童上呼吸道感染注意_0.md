## Notes for Children with Upper Respiratory Tract Infections

1. Fever may occur intermittently for 3–5 days, which is a normal process. Please take medication as prescribed, drink plenty of warm water; if body temperature exceeds 38°C without chills, use an ice pack; if body temperature exceeds 38.5°C, use fever-reducing medication.

2. When coughing severely, drink more warm water, avoid cold, sweet drinks and citrus fruits; wear a mask when going out to prevent cold air stimulation.

3. Ensure adequate rest and consume more vegetables and fruits.

4. Stay calm when experiencing fever, monitor the child's mental alertness. If necessary, call for advice on whether an emergency visit is needed; also schedule regular outpatient follow-ups.

5. If high fever persists for several days, the child shows poor mental activity, produces large amounts of yellow sputum, is drowsy, or cannot eat, please visit the clinic promptly.
