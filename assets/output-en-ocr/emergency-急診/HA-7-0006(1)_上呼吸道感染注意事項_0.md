## Precautions for Upper Respiratory Tract Infections

1. Fever may intermittently occur for 3–5 days, which is a normal process. Please take medication as prescribed, drink plenty of warm water; if the ear temperature exceeds 38°C without chills, use an ice pack; if it exceeds 38.5°C, take a warm bath.

2. When coughing severely, drink more warm water and avoid cold, sweet drinks and citrus fruits. If there is phlegm, use abdominal muscles in coordination with deep breathing to help expel the phlegm. Wear a mask when going out to avoid cold air stimulation.

3. Ensure adequate rest and consume more vegetables and fruits.

4. Stay calm when experiencing fever. If necessary, call to inquire whether another emergency visit is needed. Regular outpatient follow-up is recommended (emergency hotline: 615-0995).

5. If high fever persists, headache with neck stiffness, difficulty breathing, large amounts of yellow sputum, or inability to swallow saliva occur, please go to the emergency department immediately.
