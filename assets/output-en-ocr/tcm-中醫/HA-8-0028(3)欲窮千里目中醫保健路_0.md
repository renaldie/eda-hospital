2. Slow down your pace of life, allow your eyes to rest more, and reduce exposure to strong light or flashing stimuli from television, smartphones, and other devices. Take a 10-minute break every 30 minutes when using a computer screen, television, or reading.

3. Avoid anger and anxiety; adjust your workload and eliminate the habit of staying up late to ensure sufficient sleep.

4. Ensure adequate hydration daily, and drink 150 c.c. of water after each acupuncture session.

## (Three) Eye Massage:

Use the first joint of both index fingers to massage the acupoints around the upper and lower orbital areas, such as Qingming, Qiu Hou, and Chengyi (as shown on the cover). Press each point ten times until a mild ache or heaviness is felt; avoid directly pressing on the eyeball or applying excessive force.
