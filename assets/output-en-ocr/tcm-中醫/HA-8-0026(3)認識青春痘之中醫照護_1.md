Acne, also known as teenage pimples, is a chronic inflammatory disease of the sebaceous follicles. It commonly occurs in areas with abundant sebaceous gland activity, such as the head, face, neck, anterior chest, and back. It is prevalent among adolescents, but due to modern lifestyles characterized by fast-paced living, mental stress, heavy workloads, the rise of fast food culture, excessive consumption of spicy and greasy foods, and frequent consumption of cold drinks, acne is no longer limited to young people.

Most individuals try topical ointments to treat acne, yet overlook the fact that acne originates from within. Failing to pay attention to internal health regulation often results in only temporary relief. In reality, topical anti-inflammatory and antibacterial ointments merely treat symptoms rather than addressing the root cause. Besides inadequate external cleansing, the underlying constitution is the fundamental reason for acne. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) uses the principles of observation, auscultation and olfaction, inquiry, and palpation to precisely identify the causes of individual acne cases. By treating according to specific patterns and adjusting one's constitution, TCM can achieve more effective results in both treatment and prevention.

## One: Possible Causes of Acne

1) Abnormal keratinization at the follicular opening, leading to follicular blockage.  
2) Excessive sebum secretion: oily skin with overproduction of sebum.  
3) Bacterial proliferation and inflammation: overgrowth of *Cutibacterium acnes* and *Staphylococcus epidermidis*, causing follicular inflammation.  
4) Clogged pores: follicular inflammation, excessive keratinization, or use of cosmetics containing bromides, iodides, or mineral oils, blocking pores and resulting in facial blackheads.  
5) Hormonal imbalance: increased androgens promoting sebaceous gland development and function; elevated progesterone and low estrogen levels in women often lead to acne before menstruation.  

6) Emotional factors: mental stress, staying up late, and insufficient sleep disrupt sebaceous gland secretion, worsening acne.  
7) Genetics, poor diet and lifestyle habits, air pollution, and ultraviolet radiation.

## Two: Constitutional Types Associated with Acne

1) Lung-Channel Wind-Heat Constitution: primarily affects the nasal area. White or pinkish oily secretions can be squeezed out, with facial redness, red and swollen acne, large pus-filled lesions, skin itching and allergies, constipation, and yellowish urine. Treatment focuses on clearing lung heat, cooling blood, and clearing heat.

2) Spleen-Stomach Damp-Heat Constitution: secretions appear around the mouth. Yellowish-white, rice-grain-like sebum or pus can be squeezed out, with oily skin, scanty and yellow urine, sticky stools, bad breath, and difficulty quenching thirst. Individuals tend to eat spicy, greasy, fried foods, have poor appetite, and abdominal distension. Treatment follows the principle of clearing heat and resolving dampness.

3) Imbalance of Chong and Ren Vessels Constitution: commonly affects the mouth, nose, and between the eyebrows. Lesions are firm and difficult to resolve, with pain upon pressure, noticeable facial redness, and a sensation of heat. Acne increases before menstruation, menstrual irregularities, insomnia, and bitter taste in the mouth. Treatment involves clearing heat, cooling blood, promoting blood circulation, and resolving stasis.

4) Phlegm-Dampness and Stagnant Blood Constitution: oily skin is common. In addition to millet-sized papules on the face and back, larger nodules or cysts (the size of soybeans) often occur. The skin surface is uneven, with localized redness, swelling, and pain. The pus head is deep and hard to touch, with palpable nodules that are difficult to resolve or disappear. The surface appears dark red, prone to pigmentation and acne scars, dandruff, fever, fatigue, and loose stools. Treatment focuses on removing dampness, resolving stasis, detoxifying, and dispersing nodules.

5) Blood Heat and Toxic Stagnation Constitution: small pus-filled bumps appear at the top of pustules, with surrounding redness and swelling, accompanied by pain and heat. After the pustule heals, small atrophic scars remain on the skin surface. Symptoms often worsen after staying up late or sun exposure. Individuals experience thirst, irritability, dry mouth, bad breath, and hard stools. Treatment primarily involves nourishing yin, clearing heat, and detoxifying.

## Three: Daily Health Care for Acne

1) Avoid excessive cleansing: Use a neutral, gentle facial cleanser with warm water. Do not rub the face vigorously. Cleansing twice daily (morning and night) is sufficient. Over-cleansing can lead to skin dryness and excessive sebum production.

2) Proper skincare: Avoid overly moisturizing or occlusive skincare products and cosmetics. Choose lightweight, breathable products instead.

3) Balanced diet: Reduce intake of greasy, spicy, sweet, high-calorie, ginger, olive oil, fried, grilled, pickled, and stimulating foods. Increase consumption of vegetables and fruits and drink plenty of water.

4) Avoid bad habits: Do not squeeze acne yourself, as this may lead to infection or permanent scarring. Regularly clean and replace pillowcases and towels, especially for those with acne on the cheeks.

5) Healthy lifestyle: Maintain a regular routine, a positive mood, and sufficient sleep. Try to go to bed by 11 p.m. and avoid staying up late.
