Insomnia, in traditional medicine, is also known as "non-sleep" or "excessive sleep." Mild cases involve difficulty falling asleep, while severe cases may result in being unable to fall asleep throughout the night. Its main symptoms include difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings during sleep, poor sleep quality, and a significant reduction in sleep duration. Even if one sleeps, they may still feel unrefreshed and lack a sense of fullness the next day.

## Insomnia Prevention and Care

1. Supplementing milk, eggs, fish, or foods rich in vitamins such as carrots, citrus fruits, and kiwi can help alleviate insomnia.

2. Developing a regular exercise routine helps relax the body and mind, but avoid exercising before bedtime to prevent excessive excitement that may interfere with sleep.

3. Before sleeping, listen to soft music and dim the room lighting.

4. Avoid using 3C products, as their light may interfere with the secretion of melatonin and disrupt sleep.
