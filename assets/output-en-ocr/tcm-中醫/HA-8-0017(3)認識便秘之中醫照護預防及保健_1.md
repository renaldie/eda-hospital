## One. Primary Constipation (Non-pharmacological or Disease-related)

(1) Gastrointestinal functional abnormalities: Lack of fiber intake, irregular diet, or excessive consumption of grilled, fried, or spicy foods; insufficient fluid intake or improper weight loss leading to malnutrition; prolonged sitting and lack of physical activity. Other factors include poor lifestyle habits, excessive stress, or emotional tension.

(2) Slowed intestinal peristalsis: Abnormalities in the enteric nervous plexus located beneath the colon mucosa affect normal intestinal motility, leading to constipation.

(3) Difficult defecation: During defecation, if one cannot properly regulate the puborectalis muscle, internal and external anal sphincters, or pelvic floor muscles, it results in difficult bowel movements requiring more time to pass stool. Additionally, pain from hemorrhoids can also interfere with defecation.

## Two. Secondary Constipation (Due to Disease, Medication, or Structural Abnormalities)

(1) Medication use: Calcium channel blockers or ganglion blockers used for blood pressure control may affect the contractility of intestinal smooth muscle. Some psychotropic medications may also slow intestinal motility.

(2) Neurological disorders: Conditions such as multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, or Parkinson’s disease can impair gastrointestinal function.

(3) Structural abnormalities of the intestine: Diseases such as Hirschsprung’s disease or colorectal cancer, which involve structural and functional abnormalities of the intestine, can interfere with stool evacuation.

## Three. Dietary Recommendations and Restrictions

(1) Foods to consume: Include dietary fiber such as fruits (banana, papaya, citrus), whole grains (oats, wheat, barley, rye, black wheat, brown rice), vegetables (spinach, sweet potato leaves), nuts and seeds (walnuts, almonds, and chia seeds), which are rich in fiber and omega-3 fatty acids.

(2) Foods to avoid: Spicy and stimulating foods (such as chili, pepper, Sichuan pepper); warm and hot foods (such as lamb, dog meat, lychee, and alcoholic beverages); gas-producing and poorly digestible foods (such as potatoes, yams, onions) that cause gastrointestinal bloating; sweets that weaken intestinal peristalsis; dairy products containing calcium, which, when consumed in excess, may make bowel movements difficult.

(3) In the morning, drink one cup (300–500 ml) of warm water to promote bowel movement. For those without water restrictions, consume at least 2000 ml of fluids daily.

## Four. Daily Health Care

(1) Exercise guidance: Develop a habit of exercising for over 30 minutes daily, such as sit-ups to strengthen abdominal muscles; walking to promote gastrointestinal motility; avoid prolonged sitting and instead engage in more physical activity to improve blood and qi circulation.

(2) Establish a regular bowel habit: Defecate at the same time every day, preferably in the morning or after breakfast. When the urge to defecate arises, go to the toilet immediately and avoid suppressing the urge.

## Five. Abdominal Acupressure

In the morning, lie flat on the bed and place both hands stacked flat on the abdomen, massaging clockwise for 3–5 minutes. Alternatively, use the palm to massage specific acupoints on the abdomen.

(1) Zhongwan Point: Located at the midpoint of the line connecting the lower end of the sternum and the navel. It helps to regulate liver function, nourish the stomach, aid digestion, and strengthen the spleen and stomach.

(2) Tianchi Point: Located 3 finger-widths to the left or right of the navel in the central abdomen. It promotes intestinal motility.

(3) Qihai Point: Located 1.5 cun (approximately two finger-widths) below the navel. It helps to regulate qi and tonify qi.

## Six. Constipation-Relieving Dietary Remedies

(1) Honey Drink (diabetic patients should be cautious): Mix honey with an appropriate amount of warm water and drink. Lemon or milk can be added according to personal taste.

(2) Mulberry Tea: 40 grams of mulberry fruit and 20 grams of rock sugar.

Preparation: Brew with hot water and drink as tea. Adjust the amount of water according to personal preference.
