## Chinese herbal weight loss methods not only include adjusting body constitution with herbal formulas,

acupuncture and thread embedding also have weight loss effects. Acupuncture thread embedding is an extended treatment of acupuncture, combining traditional acupuncture with modern medical tools. It involves inserting sterile sheep gut threads into specific acupoints using special needles.

## I. Effects of Acupoint Thread Embedding

1. "Thread embedding" refers to inserting absorbable sheep gut threads into acupoints through special needles. This stimulates the body's endocrine system, nervous system, and metabolism via the acupoints, thereby achieving weight loss.

2. The selection of acupoints is primarily based on the patient's lifestyle and physical symptoms. The sheep gut thread stimulates the selected acupoints, accelerating local metabolism, regulating endocrine function, reducing appetite, promoting digestive absorption, and decreasing caloric intake. Acupoint thread embedding can also eliminate edema and enhance local firmness and body shaping.

## II. Contraindications for Thread Embedding

1. Individuals with poor wound healing ability.

2. Those with crab-foot swelling constitution.

3. Patients with infectious diseases, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, or blood coagulation disorders.

4. Self-massage of acupoints can not only aid in weight loss but also provide health benefits. Common acupoints used for weight loss include Shenshu (on the ear), Tiangu (and Daxing) on the abdomen, San Yin Jiao, Fenglong, and Zusanli on the lower leg. The massage technique involves gently pressing and rubbing the acupoints with the palm until a slight ache is felt, for 1–2 minutes per point, 3–5 times daily.

## III. Risks of Thread Embedding

Thread embedding is a safe technique, but it still carries some side effects and risks. Possible side effects include pain, swelling, bruising, infection, and allergic reactions. However, these risks and side effects are generally mild and can be minimized by careful consideration and following professional medical advice. Before undergoing treatment, it is recommended to consult a doctor about the potential risks and side effects of acupoint thread embedding, and to pay attention to post-treatment care and self-care to enhance treatment effectiveness.

## IV. Precautions for Thread Embedding

1. For three days before and after thread embedding, maintain a light diet and avoid spicy, stimulating, or seafood foods that may trigger allergies.

2. Avoid bathing, swimming, or using hot tubs for three days after the procedure.

3. If noticeable inflammation, redness, swelling, or hard lumps appear, seek medical attention promptly.

4. Avoid overeating; maintain a normal diet and combine it with regular physical activity to achieve more effective fat burning and weight loss.
