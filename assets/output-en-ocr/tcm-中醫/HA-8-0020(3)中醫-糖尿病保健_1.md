Diabetes in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) falls under the category of "Xiao Ke" (thirsty and excessive drinking). Typical manifestations include excessive thirst, increased hunger, polyuria (frequent urination), and unexplained weight loss. Through TCM treatment that regulates the spleen and stomach digestive functions, excess glucose in the blood can be reabsorbed and utilized by the body, thereby achieving effective blood glucose control. This leads to significant improvement in both clinical symptoms and blood glucose levels.

## If daily lifestyle habits do not include proper dietary control, other complications may also arise, such as hyperlipidemia, coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, and pathological changes in the eyes, kidneys, blood vessels, and nerves. Therefore, the goal of diabetes treatment is not only to lower blood glucose levels, but also to further improve blood circulation, correct metabolic abnormalities, reduce lipid levels, and improve hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values, in order to prevent future complications.

## Types of Diabetes

Modern medicine classifies diabetes into two main types: insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent. Currently, non-insulin-dependent diabetes is more common. In TCM, diabetes is further categorized into the following types:

(1) Qi and Yin Deficiency Type  
(2) Yin Deficiency with Internal Heat Type  
(3) Deficiency of both Yin and Yang Type  
(4) Qi Deficiency with Blood Stasis Type  
(5) Dry Heat Entering the Blood Type  

Among these, the Qi and Yin Deficiency Type is the most prevalent.

## II. Daily Lifestyle, Exercise, and Health Care

(1) Develop a habit of regular physical activity, aiming for 3 to 5 sessions per week, each lasting about 30 minutes. Aerobic exercises such as jogging and walking are recommended.

(2) Avoid exercising on an empty stomach. Blood glucose levels should be monitored before exercise. Carry glucose tablets or snacks to prevent hypoglycemia.

(3) Self-monitor blood glucose levels to achieve optimal glucose control and to prevent complications.

## III. Dietary Principles

(1) Eat at fixed times and in fixed portions: the quantity and timing of meals should be consistent.

(2) Maintain a balanced intake of food: include dairy, vegetables, starchy root and grain foods, eggs, beans, fish, meat, fruits, and oils.

(3) Consume more high-fiber foods: such as oats, brown rice, and various whole grains.

(4) Drink plenty of water: since patients often experience blood concentration, drinking warm, boiled water regularly can prevent this condition. Long-term consumption of cold water may disrupt the body's Qi flow and impair gastrointestinal function.

(5) Chew food slowly and thoroughly. Eating too quickly increases gastrointestinal burden and may lead to insulin secretion disorders, which are detrimental to the pancreas's ability to maintain stable blood glucose levels.

(6) Avoid cooking methods such as roasting, frying, deep-frying, or thickening with starch, as these methods can degrade food quality and increase bodily burden. High-heat cooking also increases internal "heat" in the body, making blood glucose control more difficult. Instead, prefer low-oil cooking methods such as boiling, steaming, cold-dressing, clear braising, and pickling.

(7) Avoid alcohol and excessive consumption of refined grains: alcohol can cause inflammation of the liver and pancreas and disrupt the metabolism of carbohydrates in the body. Excessive intake of refined grains such as bread, buns, dumplings, noodles, oil cakes, and pastries can lead to elevated blood glucose levels, making glucose control less stable. Therefore, both alcohol and refined grains should be strictly avoided.
