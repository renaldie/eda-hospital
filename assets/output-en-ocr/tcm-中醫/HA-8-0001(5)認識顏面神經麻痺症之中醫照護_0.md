### 3. Pressing Method:

Press facial and hand acupuncture points for 10 seconds, then rest for 5 seconds. Perform this on the face and both left and right hands for 5 minutes each, twice daily in the morning and evening.

(8) Vitamin Supplementation: Taking vitamin B complex or consuming more vegetables and fruits can help repair the nervous system.

(9) Support and companionship: Family members should strive to be attentive and caring, enhancing daily and verbal communication to help the patient build confidence and cooperate with treatment for early recovery.

Peripheral facial nerve palsy generally has a good prognosis. If the golden treatment period is recognized and if both traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine are combined for treatment, an even better outcome can be achieved.
