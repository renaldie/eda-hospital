## Asthma is a chronic inflammatory respiratory disease that causes excessive sensitivity of the airways and reversible airway obstruction. Common symptoms include shortness of breath, wheezing, throat obstruction, prolonged coughing, and nighttime coughing.

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment primarily focuses on preventing attacks by avoiding exposure to triggers that may induce asthma episodes. In addition, symptomatic treatment is provided. During an attack, immediate Western medical treatment should be administered; during routine periods, herbal medicine prescribed by a physician should be used to strengthen the body's resistance and reduce the frequency of attacks. However, it is strictly forbidden to take random medications, as this may damage the body's vital energy (zheng qi).
