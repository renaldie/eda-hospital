## One: Understanding Dysmenorrhea

Nearly one-third of women during their reproductive years experience discomfort associated with menstruation, especially lower abdominal pain occurring before and during menstruation, which may extend to the lower back and coccyx, or be accompanied by back and waist pain. In severe cases, symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, cold sweats, cold extremities, and even fainting occur, thereby affecting their normal work and quality of life.

Dysmenorrhea is caused by spasm of the uterine smooth muscle leading to reduced blood flow and ischemia. Clinically, it is commonly categorized into primary and secondary dysmenorrhea:

Primary dysmenorrhea: Also known as functional dysmenorrhea, this refers to menstrual pain without obvious organic lesions in the reproductive organs. It typically occurs in unmarried women within two years of menarche, and the pain usually arises during the ovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle.

Secondary dysmenorrhea: This results from organic lesions in the reproductive organs, such as underdeveloped uterus, endometriosis (chocolate cysts), adenomyosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, uterine cavity adhesions, or complications following the use of contraceptive devices.

## Traditional Chinese Medicine Approach to Treating Dysmenorrhea

Dysmenorrhea occurs due to individual constitution and physiological changes during menstruation and the pre- and post-menstrual periods. Constitutional factors often involve disharmony of qi and blood, obstruction of the channels, or improper dietary habits—such as excessive consumption of cold and raw foods, leading to accumulation of cold and long-term stagnation of qi and blood. This results in impaired circulation of qi and blood, and "when qi and blood do not flow, pain arises." Therefore, treatment focuses on regulating and restoring the flow of qi and blood. By identifying the root cause and adjusting the body's constitution according to the menstrual cycle, we aim to improve overall health, enhance circulation of qi and blood, and select appropriate therapies based on different patterns—such as promoting blood circulation to resolve stasis or warming the channels to dispel cold. Clinically, acupuncture and herbal medicine are used not only to relieve symptoms but also to address the underlying causes and treat the root of the problem.

## Three: Dietary Precautions

(1) Maintain a balanced diet, favoring foods with neutral properties and preferring light and simple meals.

(2) Avoid cold and cool foods such as crabs, snails, ice products, cold salads, watermelons, coconut water, and food or drinks taken directly from the refrigerator, as these may obstruct blood circulation.

(3) Avoid sour and astringent foods such as rice vinegar, pickles, green plums, loquats, and lemons.

(4) Limit consumption of fried, spicy, and stimulating foods such as chili peppers, black pepper, garlic, onions, smoke, alcohol, coffee, sambal, and curry.

(5) During the pre- and post-menstrual periods, consume warm and heating foods.

(6) Supplement vitamins C, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B6, such as nuts like walnuts, almonds, cashews, and peanuts, or whole grain bread, cereals, and brown rice.

(7) Consume small amounts of sweets, preferably those rich in iron and naturally sweet, such as raisins and red dates.

## Four: Lifestyle and Health Care

(1) Maintain a regular lifestyle and ensure adequate sleep, avoiding staying up late.

(2) Regulate emotional state, maintain an optimistic and open-minded attitude, and avoid stress, tension, or anxiety.

(3) Engage in moderate physical activity such as yoga, brisk walking, or light jogging to promote blood circulation, facilitate smooth flow of qi and blood, and aid in the expulsion of menstrual blood.

(4) During menstruation, keep the body warm—avoid bathing in cold water or swimming, and after washing hair, ensure it is completely dried to prevent exposure to cold and infection.

(5) Avoid lifting heavy objects or engaging in intense physical activity during menstruation, as this may cause excessive menstrual bleeding or prolong the period.

(6) Use heat therapy to relieve pain during menstruation.

(7) Acupressure and manual techniques:

1. Qihai point: Located 1.5 cun (two finger-widths) below the navel.

2. Guanyuan point: Located 3 cun (four finger-widths) below the navel.

3. Sanyinjiao point: Located 3 cun (four finger-widths) above the inner ankle height.

4. Xuehai point: Located 2 cun (three finger-widths) above the inner end of the femoral bone.

All these points should be pressed with the palm, 2–3 times daily, for 3–5 minutes until a sensation of soreness or heaviness is felt.
