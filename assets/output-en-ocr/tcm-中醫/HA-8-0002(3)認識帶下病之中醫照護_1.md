Vaginal discharge generally refers to the secretions from the vagina. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), it is known as "dai xia." Statistics show that 35% of gynecological patients report having vaginal discharge issues. Although these issues may seem minor, they often cause significant daily discomfort. Recurrent vaginal discharge can be managed through comprehensive TCM-based constitutional adjustment, which strengthens the body's resistance and reduces the likelihood of recurrence.

## 1. Vaginal Discharge Can Be Divided into Two Categories

1) Physiological discharge: Healthy women typically have a small amount of colorless, odorless vaginal discharge that is clear and not thick. This amount slightly increases during the premenstrual period, ovulation, and early pregnancy—this is a normal phenomenon.

2) Pathological discharge: There are noticeable changes in the amount, color, consistency, and odor of the discharge. For example, increased volume, abnormal colors such as yellow, red, green, or brown, inconsistent consistency such as pus, foam, or cottage cheese-like texture, or unusual odors such as fishy or putrid smells, or local symptoms such as itching or pain.

## Dietary Restrictions

From a TCM perspective, patients with vaginal discharge should avoid or limit certain foods:

## (1) Dietary Restrictions

1. Avoid all cold items and cold beverages.

2. Avoid cold-natured vegetables and fruits:

(1) Fruits: watermelon, honeydew melon, cantaloupe, water pear, grapefruit, pomelo, coconut water, oranges, hard persimmons, rambutan, tomatoes.

(2) Vegetables: white radish, cabbage, green beans, bitter gourd, cucumber, loofah, winter melon, asparagus, bamboo shoots.

3. Avoid spicy, hot, grilled, and fried foods:

(1) Spicy foods: chili peppers, black pepper, Sichuan pepper, eight-cornered spice, garlic, coriander, scallions, sambal paste.

(4) Stimulating foods: pickled foods, coffee, curry.

4. Avoid smoking, alcohol, and alcoholic foods: such as ginseng wine, deer antler wine, as consuming these after meals may worsen inflammation and congestion.

## (2) Suitable Foods

Papaya, apple, grapes, orange, papaya, strawberry, cherry, mulberry, water spinach, spinach, red radish, chives, cauliflower, black fungus.

## 3. External Medications

In addition to internal medication, severe cases may use external sitz baths prescribed by a doctor. For example, herbs such as honeysuckle, phellodendron, forsythia, sophora root, rhubarb, gentian, chrysanthemum, Chinese yam, and other herbs prescribed by a doctor can be used for sitz baths, soaking for 5–10 minutes.

## 4. Daily Lifestyle Precautions

(1) Wear loose-fitting pants and avoid jeans.

(2) Choose cotton underwear that is loose and comfortable, and keep the genital area clean and dry at all times.

(3) Change sanitary pads frequently during menstruation.

(4) After using the toilet, wipe the perineal area in a fixed direction.

(5) Drink water before intercourse and urinate after intercourse.

(6) Avoid sitz baths, warm baths, or soaking in hot springs temporarily.

(7) Do not use soap or disinfectants to clean the perineal area. Over-cleaning the internal vaginal area can disrupt the natural pH balance of the vagina, leading to abnormal overgrowth of bacteria, which may result in increased vaginal discharge.

(8) Minimize the use of sanitary pads in daily life.

## 5. Food Remedies

Four-herb Soup: 10 grams of lotus seed, 6 grams of water caltrop, 1.5 ounces of coix seed, 6 grams of poria, 10 grams of yam, and 4 pieces of ligusticum. Add 600 grams of pork ribs or pig small intestine (or half a pig's stomach). This remedy helps strengthen the spleen, remove dampness, and stop abnormal discharge.

## 6. Acupressure

Press the San Yin Jiao point, located 3 cun (approximately four fingers apart when hands are together) above the inner ankle, on the posterior aspect of the tibia, in the depression. Press for 3 minutes each time. It can also be combined with moxibustion (as shown in the figure below).
