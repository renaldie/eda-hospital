The liver is not just a "silent" organ; hepatitis itself is a hidden "killer." Therefore, people should have basic awareness of liver diseases in daily life in order to find effective methods for treating and protecting the liver. In Taiwan, a high number of individuals are infected with hepatitis, which has led chronic hepatitis to be nicknamed "national disease." Maintaining liver health is not difficult—only by possessing correct liver-protective knowledge and being alert to the body's warning signals can one effectively manage liver health.

## I. Health and Wellness Practices

In traditional Chinese medicine, liver protection and nourishment involve improving the body's internal environment to maintain normal circulation and regulation, enhance resistance to disease, and reduce the burden on the liver.

1) Balance work and rest: Adequate rest and moderate physical activity, without causing fatigue, can reduce the liver's burden, allow more nutrients to be delivered to the liver, and thus promote liver cell regeneration and recovery of liver function.

2) Use medications cautiously: When taking medication, avoid increasing the liver's burden. Medications should only be used when necessary; overuse of liver-protective drugs or drugs harmful to the liver should be avoided.

3) Avoid alcohol damage: When liver function is impaired, the body's ability to metabolize alcohol decreases, and the metabolic byproducts of alcohol can damage liver cells.

4) Seek timely medical treatment: Regular blood tests and ultrasound examinations help monitor disease progression and assist in formulating appropriate traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions.

(5) Appropriate diet: In daily life, eat small meals frequently, and consume fresh, easily digestible, high-protein, high-carbohydrate, and high-fiber foods such as fresh fish, lean meat, protein, and fresh fruits and vegetables.

(6) Dietary restrictions: Due to liver disease impairing bile secretion and leading to poor absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins, one should avoid oily, high-fat foods and spicy, stimulating foods such as fried foods, coffee, and tea.
