## ☐ Facial paralysis is frightening

Xiao Qiu stayed up late last night due to work overtime until 1 to 2 a.m.

This morning when he woke up... oh no! His right side feels numb. When he looked in the mirror, he found he couldn't perform actions such as puffing out his cheeks, frowning, wrinkling his forehead, or showing teeth. When he tried to close his eyes forcefully, the right eyelid wouldn't close, he had a whistling sound when speaking, saliva leaked from his mouth, and food would get stuck between his teeth and cheeks when eating. Xiao Qiu and his family were worried whether this might be a stroke, so they rushed to the hospital for examination. The doctor diagnosed it as "peripheral facial nerve palsy," possibly caused by viral infection leading to facial nerve paralysis or edema.

## I. Causes and Symptoms

## Facial nerve palsy is also known as Bell's palsy

(Bell's palsy). It is generally believed to be related to viral infection and typically occurs during periods of fatigue or when immunity is weakened. It commonly affects individuals aged 20 to 50, with more cases in males than females. Clinically, it is mostly unilateral, with main symptoms including drooping of the eyebrow, mouth corner deviation (toward the healthy side), facial muscle paralysis, disappearance or shallowing of forehead wrinkles and inability to raise the eyebrows; loss of facial reflexes such as frowning; disappearance or shallowing of the nasolabial fold; inability to close the eyes or observing upward rotation of the eyeball when closing the eyes; facial swelling, reduced tear production, ear pain, tinnitus, ear fullness, loss of taste, and headache.

## II. Traditional Chinese Medicine Perspective

In Traditional Chinese Medicine, "peripheral facial nerve palsy" is referred to as "facial paralysis" or "mouth and eye deviation." It is believed that the cause of the disease is a deficiency of qi and blood, leading to external wind invading the meridians due to a weakened defense.

## III. Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatment Principles

Treatment in Traditional Chinese Medicine combines acupuncture and herbal medicine. Depending on the diagnosis, herbs with pungent-cool or pungent-warm properties are selected to resolve exterior conditions. The main approach involves selecting acupoints distally or on the healthy side, and combining this with infrared lamp irradiation at the acupuncture site.

## IV. Daily Health Care

(1) Local head warmth: Avoid direct exposure to fans or cold air; use warm water to wash the face.

(2) Eye protection: Reduce screen time, wear sunglasses when going out, and use an eye mask before bed to protect the eyes and prevent foreign objects from entering.

(3) Facial rehabilitation exercises: Perform various facial expressions in front of a mirror to promote voluntary movement. Do this at least three times a day. Examples include raising and frowning the eyebrows, tightly closing both eyes and blinking, making a ghost face, blowing up a balloon, sucking, and chewing gum to activate facial muscles and improve blood circulation.

(4) Warm compress: Apply a warm towel to the face for 10 minutes each time to improve blood circulation.

(5) Dietary recommendations: Eat small meals frequently, focusing on easily digestible foods. Avoid spicy, hot, stimulating, rough, hard, oily, and stagnant stomach foods.
