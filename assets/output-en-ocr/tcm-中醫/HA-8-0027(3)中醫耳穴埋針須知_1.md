Moxibustion at auricular acupoints involves embedding intradermal needles into specific points on the ear to treat diseases. The insertion of intradermal needles into auricular acupoints produces a gentle and sustained stimulation, which helps consolidate therapeutic effects, prevent recurrence, and thus alleviate or cure diseases and certain symptoms. This method is particularly suitable for chronic conditions, patients with weak constitution, or those who cannot undergo long-term acupuncture therapy. Its advantages include simple operation, broad range of indications, few side effects, and good therapeutic outcomes.

## I. Indications

Auricular acupuncture therapy has a wide range of applications in preventing and treating diseases, and is applicable across various medical disciplines, such as:

(1) Various painful conditions: e.g., headaches, trigeminal neuralgia, sprains, and contusions.

(2) Various inflammatory conditions: e.g., pharyngitis, rheumatoid arthritis, tonsillitis.

(3) Functional disorders: e.g., gastrointestinal neurofunctional disorders, excessive sweating, menstrual irregularities.

(4) Allergies: e.g., measles, asthma, allergic rhinitis.

(5) Other conditions: e.g., hypertension, obesity.

## II. Contraindications

(1) Patients with ulcers or other lesions on the outer ear should temporarily avoid auricular acupuncture treatment.

(2) Patients with blood-related disorders such as hemophilia should not undergo auricular acupuncture treatment.

(3) Pregnant women should use this method with caution; women with a history of habitual abortion are strictly prohibited from receiving auricular needle embedding therapy.

## III. Precautions

(1) The duration of auricular needle placement is 3 to 5 days.

(2) During the needle placement period, patients can press on the needle site 3 to 4 times daily, each press lasting 1 to 2 minutes, to enhance therapeutic effects.

(3) Pressing method: use the tip of a single finger or two fingers to gently press downward or against the needle site; the pressing force should be applied until pain is avoided.

(4) After 3 to 5 days, remove the paper adhesive and the needle from the ear site by lifting it from the bottom upward.

(5) The auricular needle site should remain dry; the area should not be wet or submerged. After bathing, immediately use a dry towel or sanitary paper to gently pat and absorb moisture from the adhesive.

(6) If inflammation signs such as redness, swelling, heat, or pain appear at the needle site, remove the adhesive and the needle immediately.
