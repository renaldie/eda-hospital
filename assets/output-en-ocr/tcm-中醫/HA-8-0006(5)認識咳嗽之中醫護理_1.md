Taiwanese proverb: "Earth and water masters fear missing leaks, doctors fear treating coughs—thus it is evident that 'coughing' often leaves doctors puzzled and difficult to manage. In reality, treating coughing requires careful differentiation to identify the underlying causes. Only by targeting the root cause can effective therapeutic outcomes be achieved."

## I. Causes of Coughing

Coughing occurs when the larynx or trachea is stimulated and is one of the body's self-protective mechanisms, helping to clear foreign substances and secretions from the respiratory tract. In Western medicine, coughing is divided into acute and chronic types: acute cough typically resolves within about three weeks, while chronic cough is defined as coughing lasting more than eight weeks. Coughing often results from sudden changes in weather or climate, leading to inadequate adaptation by the body and disruption of its defensive functions. Symptoms can be categorized into two major types: external (exogenous) and internal (endogenous) causes. External coughing results from the six external pathogenic factors (six yin) entering the lungs via the mouth, nose, or skin. Internal coughing arises from dysfunction of internal organs, with pathogenic factors affecting the lungs or lung-related pathologies. This type is generally more difficult to treat, with coughing being the primary symptom.

## II. Possible Causes of Coughing Symptoms

(1) Respiratory inflammation and infection: caused by viruses or bacteria.

(2) Allergic diseases: such as allergic rhinitis and bronchial asthma.

(3) Tumors: tumors in the nose, pharynx, trachea, or lungs may cause coughing.

(4) Irritating factors: exposure to air, smoke, or foreign bodies in the respiratory tract can trigger coughing.

(5) Diseases: such as pulmonary embolism, pericardial effusion, tuberculosis, etc.

(6) Other causes: stimulation of the diaphragmatic nerve, gastroesophageal reflux due to medication, etc.

## III. Prevention and Health Care

(1) Quit smoking and improve living environment quality by actively eliminating smoke, dust, and harmful gases. If air quality is poor, wear a mask or minimize outdoor exposure.

(2) Pay attention to climate changes, prevent colds, and engage in moderate exercise to enhance immunity.

(3) Eat light foods and avoid oily, spicy, and hot (e.g., chili, pepper, alcohol) foods.

(4) Avoid cold and cooling foods such as watermelon, oranges, and white radish.

(5) Sweet foods tend to produce phlegm; thus, avoid overly sweet and greasy foods.

(6) When experiencing throat inflammation, swelling, and yellow phlegm, avoid consuming nourishing foods such as Dongmu duck, lamb stew, danggui, renshen, dangshen, huangqi, etc. Also avoid spicy, fried foods, coffee, strong tea, lychee, longan, and durian—foods with hot properties. Instead, consume cooling foods such as white radish, cucumbers, loquat, and pears.

(7) If phlegm is thin and white and the throat is itchy—indicating a cold condition—avoid cold foods such as ice, watermelon, oranges, and white radish. Instead, consume mild and warming fruits like tangerine and grapes.

(8) Drink plenty of warm water. When drinking, hold the water in your mouth before slowly swallowing to enhance throat lubrication and phlegm clearance, and to avoid side effects such as bloating or frequent urination.

(9) For those with sensitive noses: avoid irritants and pay attention to keeping the nose warm, while also massaging nasal acupoints (e.g., Yingxiang point).

(10) For coughing caused by illness: follow medical advice, take medication as prescribed, rest adequately, avoid overexertion; during cold weather, stay warm and avoid exposure to wind and cold. Avoid going out to prevent worsening of the condition.

## IV. Dietary Remedies for Coughing

## The following dietary remedies should be tailored to individual constitution

(1) Pear juice: For those with cough lasting more than seven days, cut a water pear, remove the tip to form a cup-like shape, remove the core, and place 1 coin of chuanbei powder into the core. Add honey as needed. Re-cover the pear and steam it in a water bath. Both the pear and the juice can be consumed.

(2) Honey: Has the effects of clearing heat and moistening dryness. For coughs caused by tracheitis, it can alleviate throat dryness and itching, and help facilitate the smooth expulsion of phlegm from the trachea. As a daily beverage, honey water can be consumed as tea. After drinking, coughing decreases, and the risk of throat damage from severe coughing is reduced. However, infants under one year of age should not consume honey due to underdeveloped immune systems.
