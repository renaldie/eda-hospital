It is recommended to adopt a balanced diet to ensure adequate caloric intake. For elderly individuals who need to manage their weight, avoid excessively restricting calories, as this may lead to malnutrition and increase the risk of frailty. Consume high-quality protein at a rate of 1.0–1.2 grams per kilogram of body weight daily to prevent muscle loss. Examples include milk, yogurt, eggs, chicken, and fish. Vegetarians can obtain protein from soy milk, tofu, soybean products, and other soy-based foods.

## (2) Regular Physical Exercise

Daily moderate physical activity helps frail individuals improve muscle strength and bone density, stabilize gait, and reduce the risk of falls. Recommended exercises include muscle endurance training, resistance exercises, and stretching. It is advised to perform 30–60 minutes of exercise three times per week. Examples include using resistance bands or dumbbells for resistance training, hiking, and tai chi.

## (3) Lifestyle Modifications

Regular health check-ups and vaccinations are essential. Schedule regular follow-up visits and strengthen the management of existing chronic conditions to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Spend more time outdoors during the day for sun exposure, participate in social activities and community programs (such as community care and support centers, C-level neighborhood long-term care stations), develop leisure hobbies, and maintain a positive mood.
