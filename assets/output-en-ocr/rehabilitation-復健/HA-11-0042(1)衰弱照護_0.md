# Frailty Care

## One. Definition of Frailty

A clinical phenotype characterized by physical function decline, considered a precursor to disability, and prone to various complications such as reduced ability to perform daily activities, falls, sarcopenia, cognitive impairment, and depression, thereby lowering quality of life and increasing risks of rehospitalization or institutionalization. Early detection and timely intervention—through dietary adjustments, physical activity, and lifestyle modifications—can still offer opportunities for functional recovery, preventing and delaying disability.

## Two. Applicable Population

Individuals who have undergone professional assessment and meet the criteria for frailty.

## Three. Manifestations of Frailty

| Walking speed reduction | Decreased muscle strength, decreased grip strength |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Unintentional weight loss | Poor appetite |
| Frequent falls | Self-perceived fatigue and lack of energy |
| Reduced activity level, requiring assistance with daily living activities | Cognitive decline |

## Four. Frailty Screening Tools:

Frailty Screening (Study of Osteoporotic Fractures, SOF): If one criterion is met, it indicates pre-frailty; if two or more criteria are met, it defines frailty. Screening indicators are as follows:

| Criterion | Indicator |
|---------|-----------|
| 1. Weight loss | Has body weight decreased by 3 kg or 5% or more over the past year without intentional weight reduction? |
| 2. Decreased muscle strength | Unable to stand up from a chair five times without using hand support? |
| 3. Reduced energy | Feeling fatigued and lacking motivation to perform daily tasks for three or more days in the past week? |

## ★ When frailty issues are present

Individuals may seek further evaluation at the "Comprehensive Geriatric Clinic" or "Rehabilitation Department" at Yida Medical Clinic.
