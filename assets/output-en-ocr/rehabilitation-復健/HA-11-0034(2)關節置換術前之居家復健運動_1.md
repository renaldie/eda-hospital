## Notes:

(1) Before exercising, assess your pain level. Only proceed with at-home rehabilitation exercises if you experience mild pain.

(2) For each exercise, perform it 4 times daily, maintaining or exerting effort for 5~15 seconds, depending on your pain level.

(3) After exercise, if pain occurs, apply ice for 10~15 minutes. Additionally, follow the medication prescription prescribed by your doctor to achieve optimal rehabilitation outcomes.

(4) If you experience severe pain during exercise, stop immediately and rest.

(5) Exercise with caution and take precautions to prevent falls.
