# Techniques for Moving Between Bed and Chair

## 1. Definition:

Turning refers to the transition between different planes of posture. Physical activities can help restore strength and prevent complications caused by prolonged bed rest. Early bed-to-chair mobility during hospitalization may be affected by patient weakness or treatment. If there are impairments in functional movement or balance, turning ability will be compromised, increasing the risk of falls. To balance early mobility with safety and avoid injury, learning correct turning techniques is crucial.

2. Applicable Population: Patients with weakness, limb mobility impairments, or those who require assistance with daily activities.
