# Step-by-step for walking with assistive devices

Walking with assistive devices steps: Adjustment, Preparation +1, +2, +3 (look forward, avoid dizziness)

1. Definition (noun explanation): Assistive walking devices refer to tools that help with walking, such as canes, walkers, or wheelchairs. Users can transfer part of their body weight to their upper limbs, reducing the burden on their lower limbs. By using assistive devices, the overall base of support during movement is increased, enhancing stability during activities.

2. Applicable population: Individuals with weak lower limbs, limb mobility impairments, or those who require equipment to walk.

3. Care methods: For patients with difficulty in repositioning, assistive devices can help them walk independently, effectively preventing skeletal deformities and improving poor posture, thereby enhancing their ability to adapt to their environment.
