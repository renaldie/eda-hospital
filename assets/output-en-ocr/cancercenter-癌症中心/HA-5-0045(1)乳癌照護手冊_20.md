Introduction and overview of the implantable injection port (port-A)

Four: Daily self-care for the implantable injection port (port-A):

1. After surgery, a cosmetic adhesive will be applied to the incision site and covered with sterile gauze. The cosmetic adhesive does not need to be changed—just let it naturally fall off. However, daily check for signs of redness, swelling, heat, pain, or excessive discharge or bleeding should be performed; if any of these symptoms occur, it may indicate infection, and you should immediately return to see your doctor for evaluation.

2. On the day of surgery, your doctor will schedule a follow-up appointment. During the time at home, use a wiping method when bathing; only after your doctor evaluates and confirms wound healing can you switch to showering.

3. There are no activity restrictions, but avoid intense physical activities. For the arm on the same side as the artificial vessel, avoid full 360-degree rotation, lifting objects over 4.5 kilograms, direct impacts or pressure on the protruding area, to prevent displacement of the artificial vessel.

4. If the artificial vessel is not in use, it must be regularly reviewed every 1–2 months or as needed; after approval, visit the injection room where the port will be flushed once with normal saline containing anticoagulant (Heparin) to prevent catheter blockage.

5. Pay attention to the backflow of the artificial vessel each time, as this provides important information for your doctor or nurse to assess the function of the artificial vessel in the next visit.
