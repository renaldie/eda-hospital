## (Four) Dry Mouth

## ★ Dietary Principles and Improvement Methods:

1. Chewing ice cubes, chewing sugar-free gum, drinking diluted tea, lemon juice, or high-calorie beverages.

2. Prepare food in a smoother, more slippery form, such as jellies, meat paste, or pudding. Eating food mixed with meat broth or meat stock can also help with swallowing.

3. Avoid foods with overly strong seasonings, such as excessively salty, concentrated, or spicy foods.

4. Avoid alcoholic beverages.

5. Rinse the mouth regularly, but do not overuse mouthwash to maintain oral moisture, prevent oral infections, and protect teeth.

6. Avoid breathing through the mouth; if necessary, use artificial saliva to reduce the sensation of dry mouth.

1. Make the green jade mixture:

(1) Wash the spinach and keep only the leaves. Place the spinach and eggs into a blender and mix them thoroughly using a blending stick.

(2) Pour the spinach-egg mixture into a flat pan and stir continuously during the cooking process to prevent sticking. When the liquid has mostly evaporated, remove from heat.

2. Chop the onion and mushrooms into small pieces.

3. Heat a little oil in a pan, add the chopped onion and stir-fry lightly. Then add the mushrooms and continue stir-frying.

4. When the aroma is released, add the green jade mixture and small fish, and stir-fry briefly.

5. Add brown rice and an appropriate amount of stock or water. Cook until the desired consistency is reached. Season with salt and white pepper, then serve.
