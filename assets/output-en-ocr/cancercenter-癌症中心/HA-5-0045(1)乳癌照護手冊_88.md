## National Health Insurance - Major Illness Certificate

As long as it is confirmed that one has cancer (with histopathological reports confirming malignant tumors), and after assistance from the hospital to obtain a major illness card, the card will be directly recorded on the health insurance IC card.

To alleviate the medical expenses burden for patients with serious illnesses, Article 48 of the National Health Insurance Act stipulates that insured individuals will be exempt from out-of-pocket costs for emergency and outpatient visits when receiving treatment due to major illnesses.

If you have any questions regarding major illness certification, you may inquire at the hospital where you are receiving treatment or at local health insurance service offices. For information on application and renewal procedures, please refer to:

## Workers' Compensation - Disability Benefits

When workers suffer occupational injuries or develop occupational diseases, and after treatment, their symptoms become fixed and further treatment fails to improve the treatment outcomes, and such conditions are diagnosed as permanent disability by a designated hospital or clinic under the National Health Insurance system, they may qualify for workers' compensation disability benefits.

Since there are various types of disability benefits under the Workers' Compensation Insurance, please refer to the "Workers' Compensation - Benefits - Disability Services" section on the Labor Insurance Bureau's official website. For inquiries, call (02) 2396-1266, extension 2250, or ask your treating physician whether you meet the eligibility criteria.
