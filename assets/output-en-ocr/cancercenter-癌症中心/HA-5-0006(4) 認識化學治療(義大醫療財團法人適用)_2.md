## I. Understanding Chemotherapy

## (1) Purpose of Chemotherapy

1. Treat cancer, even curing certain types of cancer.

2. Slow down cancer cell growth.

3. Prevent cancer cell spread.

4. Alleviate symptoms caused by cancer.

5. Improve patients' quality of life.

## (2) Mechanism of Action of Chemotherapy

Normal cells go through a regular life cycle from growth to death. When cells mutate or are exposed to carcinogens and accumulate sufficient genetic changes, they may become "cancer cells." Chemotherapy uses anticancer drugs to inhibit cancer cell division or interfere with their critical physiological processes, thereby eliminating cancer cells.

## (3) Where is Chemotherapy Administered?

1. Chemotherapy is generally administered in a chemotherapy room or ward via intravenous infusion.

2. It can also be taken orally at home or using a portable injection device.
