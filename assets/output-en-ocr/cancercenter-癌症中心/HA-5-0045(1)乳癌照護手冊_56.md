## Edema-reducing exercises

Exercises performed while wearing compression bandages or compression sleeves are most effective.

☐ Purpose:

1. Muscle pump effect

2. Increased heart rate (arterial pulsation pulls deep lymphatic vessels)

3. Muscle tissue congestion, increasing oxygen supply to tissues

4. Lung contraction, intrathoracic pressure, accelerating lymph flow into the right and left venous angles

5. Through diaphragmatic breathing, causing passive contraction and expansion of the thoracic duct

Types of edema-reducing exercises

Diaphragmatic breathing to open deep lymphatic vessels

Massage of the clavicular, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes to open lymph nodes

Upper limb edema-reducing exercises – supine or seated positions

Upper limb elastic band exercises – muscle strength training
