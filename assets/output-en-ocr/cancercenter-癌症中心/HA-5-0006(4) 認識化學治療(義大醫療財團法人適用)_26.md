## ★ Shrimp Roll Baozi

## 【Ingredients】

Baozi dough – 75g in-lai flour, 35g tawu flour, 300g water.

Shrimp and seasoning – 12 shrimp, 1 tsp salt, a pinch of white pepper, 1 tsp sesame oil, 1 egg white.

Sauce – a little light soy sauce, a little dark soy sauce, 1 tsp sesame oil, appropriate amount of water.

## 【Method】

1. Mix the baozi ingredients (in-lai flour, tawu flour, water) thoroughly.

2. Boil a large pot of water, then heat the steaming tray before pouring in 1/4 of the water. Cover the pot and steam for 3 minutes (this recipe serves four portions).

3. While waiting, prepare the sauce by mixing all sauce ingredients evenly.

4. After 3 minutes of steaming, open the lid and you will see a smooth, fully cooked baozi skin.

5. Remove the steaming tray, gently lift the edges with your hands, then carefully peel the baozi skin.

6. Place three shrimp on top and roll it up.

## ★ Steamed Egg

【Ingredients】

2 eggs, 1 tsp garlic minced, appropriate amount of cold tap water, 1–2 tsp soy sauce.

【Method】

1. Beat two eggs in a bowl and stir them evenly with a spoon.

2. Add garlic and soy sauce, stir thoroughly. Try to avoid bubbles on the surface.

3. Along the rim of the bowl, slowly pour in cold water so that the water flows down the bowl wall into the egg mixture to prevent bubble formation. (The amount of water should be roughly equal to the egg mixture. More water results in a smoother, softer texture; less water makes it firmer. Adjust according to personal preference.)
