## Despair

During this phase, patients may feel completely unmotivated about life and unable to perceive the meaning of life. However, such a state helps patients temporarily isolate themselves from external stimuli during difficult moments in life, until their mindset improves and they find turning points within their struggles and gradually move out of this phase.

## Acceptance

This refers to patients acknowledging the real losses they have experienced as a result of this life-altering event. It requires genuine self-reflection, as no one knows better than oneself what extent of acceptance is possible. "Acceptance" itself is not a definable endpoint, but can also be a spiritual state.

By understanding the five stages of cancer-related psychological responses, the goal is not to label patients' emotional states, but rather to provide a somewhat structured model that helps us recognize where we currently are in the process. Recognizing that many others have gone through similar experiences and feelings may allow us to approach our own situation with a calmer mindset, to assess our own resources, and to begin thinking about what we can do for ourselves. This requires us to choose courage and wisdom, to reflect thoughtfully upon our current circumstances.

When you turn inward, you might, for a brief moment, see a real and unfamiliar version of yourself within the surgical wound. The things flowing through your blood are no longer just chemical agents—they may become the courage to face life and death.

You are not becoming fearful; you are simply becoming more aware of the preciousness of life. Others may no longer understand you, but you have the opportunity to know yourself better.
