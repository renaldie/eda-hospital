## Three: Why should a port-A device be implanted and what are its benefits?

Patients receiving long-term chemotherapy may experience vein thrombosis or hardening of the veins and skin, which increases the difficulty of injections and causes physical and psychological discomfort. If chemotherapy drugs leak accidentally, it may lead to local vascular and tissue necrosis.

The port-A device is specifically designed for patients requiring long-term and repeated drug administration. It eliminates the pain of repeated intravenous needle insertions, making it both safe and convenient. It can be used not only for drug injections or continuous infusion, but also for blood draws and laboratory testing. Additionally, blood products, nutrition, or other liquids can be administered through this device.

## Four: Daily self-care for the port-A device:

1. After surgery, a cosmetic adhesive will be applied to the wound and covered with sterile gauze. The cosmetic adhesive does not need to be changed—just let it naturally fall off. However, daily checks should be performed to monitor for signs of redness, swelling, heat, pain, or excessive discharge or bleeding, which may indicate infection. If any of these symptoms occur, the patient should immediately return to see a doctor for evaluation.

2. The doctor will schedule a follow-up appointment on the day of surgery. During the recovery period, bathing should be done using a wiping method. Only after the doctor evaluates and confirms wound healing can a shower be resumed.
