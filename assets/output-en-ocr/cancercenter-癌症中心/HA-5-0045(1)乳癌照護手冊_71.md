## Management of Treatment Side Effects and Improvement Strategies

## Neutropenia

1. Maintain oral hygiene after meals to reduce the risk of infection.  
2. Prefer cooked foods and avoid raw fish, raw vegetables (such as in salad), raw eggs, and pickled foods (such as candied fruits).  
3. Choose fruits with skin removed whenever possible; if skin cannot be removed, rinse thoroughly with drinking water before consumption.  
4. Avoid drinking commercially available beverages containing ice (such as shake drinks).  
5. Use separate cutting boards and knives for raw and cooked foods.  
6. Maintain a balanced diet, including high-calorie and high-protein foods (such as beans, fish, eggs, and meat), as well as vegetables and fruits rich in phytochemicals, such as mushrooms, green broccoli, carrots, eggplants, apples, kiwi, papaya, and dragon fruit.

## Anemia

1. Consume iron-rich foods such as red meat, salmon, egg yolks, whole grains, dark green leafy vegetables, or seaweed.  
2. Increase intake of protein-rich foods such as dairy products, legumes, fish, eggs, and meat.  
3. Eat vitamin C-rich foods (which enhance iron absorption), such as dark green and yellow-red vegetables and fruits.  
4. Vitamin B12 is one of the key elements in red blood cell production. Vitamin B12 is primarily found in animal-based foods; plant-based sources include seaweed and kelp.
