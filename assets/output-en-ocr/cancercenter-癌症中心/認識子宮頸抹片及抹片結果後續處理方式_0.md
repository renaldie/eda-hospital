## Seven. Explanation of Colposcopy

The method of colposcopy is similar to that of cervical smear testing, and the examination takes about 5–6 minutes. The doctor will use a speculum (duck-billed) to widen the vagina, apply acetic acid (or another solution) to the surface of the cervix, and then use a colposcope to magnify and examine changes in the cervical epithelial cells and blood vessels in order to detect early signs of cervical disease. If necessary, a biopsy will be taken for pathological examination.

## Eight. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Test

Cervical cancer is primarily caused by infection with certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV). The sampling method is the same as that used in smear testing, to check whether the cervical cells are infected with this virus. A positive result indicates the presence of viral infection. A small number of persistent infections may pose a potential risk of progressing to pre-cancerous lesions or cervical cancer.

## Nine. Frequently Asked Questions

※ Do women who have never had sexual intercourse or who have gone through menopause need cervical smear testing?

Yes: After HPV infection, it may take 10–20 years or even longer to progress to cervical cancer. Therefore, all women who have had sexual contact—regardless of whether they have gone through menopause—should undergo regular cervical smear testing.

## Do I need cervical smear testing after a hysterectomy?

Yes: Women who have undergone a hysterectomy due to cervical cancer or pre-cancerous lesions are at a higher risk of developing vaginal cancer, so it is recommended that they continue to undergo regular cervical smear testing.

☐ For women who have had a hysterectomy due to benign conditions, please consult your physician to determine whether cervical smear testing is necessary.

※ Do women without sexual experience need cervical smear testing?

No: Women without sexual experience have a very low risk of developing cervical cancer. Additionally, cervical smear testing may compromise the integrity of the hymen.

$ ^{※} $ Can sexual activity continue if cervical smear results are abnormal?

Yes: Sexual activity does not worsen abnormal cells or transmit the condition to a partner. Therefore, there is no need to change one's current sexual lifestyle. However, it is recommended to use condoms.
