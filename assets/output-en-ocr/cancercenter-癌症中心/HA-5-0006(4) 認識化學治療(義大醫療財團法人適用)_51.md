IV. Management of Extravasation (Must be carried out as prescribed by a physician)

1. Administer analgesics as prescribed by the physician.

2. Elevate the affected limb. Apply cold or warm compresses as instructed by medical personnel (depending on the type of medication), for 20 minutes each time, four times daily, for one to two days.

## V. Preventive Measures for Extravasation

1. Carefully select the injection site and confirm that the intravenous site or peripheral catheter has good blood return before administering chemotherapeutic drugs.

2. When administering chemotherapeutic drugs via peripheral veins, choose large vessels in the forearm, avoiding the dorsal hand, wrist inner side, wrist joint, and anterior elbow fossa.

3. For patients requiring multiple courses of chemotherapy, it is recommended to implant a peripheral venous access device (must be evaluated by a physician).

4. Enhance patient education regarding extravasation, including symptoms and warning signs. Patient involvement in the prevention of extravasation enables early detection and reduces the incidence of extravasation.

5. During chemotherapy treatment, if movement is required, patients should move within the hospital room and avoid going outside. Avoid any pulling or tugging actions.
