## 【Method】

1. Wash the Qingjiang greens, separate the leaves from the stems and cut into pieces; chop the shiitake stems into small pieces; finely chop the garlic and ginger for later use.

2. Heat a pan over medium heat, add oil and sauté the garlic and ginger until fragrant.

3. Add the ground pork and stir-fry until it changes color and emits a meaty aroma; then add the shiitake stems and stir-fry briefly; add the green stem pieces and stir-fry evenly until well combined. Season with a suitable amount of salt and soy sauce.

4. Add the rinsed and drained white rice and stir-fry thoroughly to mix with the vegetables.

5. Pour in 2 cups of chicken broth, cover the pot and bring to a boil until white steam rises from the edge of the pot. Then reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes.

6. Open the lid, gently stir the rice to check its texture (if it's not soft enough, cover and continue cooking briefly). Add the remaining green leaves, stir well, then turn off the heat and cover to let it rest for 2 minutes.
