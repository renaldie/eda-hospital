## Psychological Adaptation

Facing cancer brings a significant threat to life, posing a major impact on both the body and mind. In the early stages of diagnosis, unfamiliarity with the disease, fear and anxiety, and the invasive treatments during diagnosis and therapy can lead to feelings of anxiety and suffering. However, since the situation is life-threatening, many considerations must be made, and each person's circumstances differ.

## Initial Psychological Reactions to Cancer Diagnosis

## Denial

A cancer diagnosis, which is unexpected, brings life closer to the unknown and death. This often makes patients and their family and friends unable to accept it at first, and some may even question whether they truly have cancer. Some may insist on returning to their previous lives and avoid treatment altogether.

## Anger

When a diagnosis is confirmed, treatment options are chosen, and treatment begins, feelings of anger may emerge. This is often accompanied by emotions such as fear, loneliness, and sadness. Due to cultural taboos, these emotions—especially anger—are suppressed, making it difficult to relieve them.

## Bargaining

Whether or not one has religious beliefs, people may often plead with heaven, asking if this entire situation could just be a bad dream.
