## My Treatment Options

|  |  |
|---|---|
| ☐ Adjuvant therapy | Systemic treatment (chemotherapy +/- targeted or immunotherapy) → surgery → additional treatment with curative intent |
| ☐ Neoadjuvant therapy | Surgery → systemic treatment (chemotherapy +/- targeted or immunotherapy) → additional treatment with curative intent |
| ☐ Palliative therapy | For advanced patients, surgery is not the priority. The main goals are disease control, prolonging life, and maintaining quality of life. |
