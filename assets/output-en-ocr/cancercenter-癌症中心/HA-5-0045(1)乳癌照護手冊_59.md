## 58 Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatment for Breast Cancer

## Emphasis on Combining Strengthening the Body's Vital Energy with Eliminating Pathogenic Factors

1. When undergoing surgical, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy—treatments aimed at attacking cancerous factors—supplementary traditional Chinese herbal medicine to strengthen the body's vital energy is essential. In addition, nutritional support is also important. For example, mushrooms contain lentinan, which can enhance the immune function of cancer patients. Carrots, tomatoes, and pumpkins contain beta-carotene, vitamin C, and trace elements such as zinc, manganese, and copper, all of which have antioxidant properties. Green vegetables are rich in vitamin C. Garlic and onions have strong antibacterial and anticancer effects.

2. Choose vegetables and herbs that are both food and have anticancer properties, such as horse radish, golden needle flowers, yam, walnuts, nori, seaweed, water caltrop, lotus seeds, taro, and lotus root.

## Pay Attention to the Nature and Functions of Foods—Apply Food Therapy According to Individual Constitution

*The Golden Chamber of Medical Essentials*: "The types of food consumed may either be suitable for the illness or harmful to the body. If appropriate, they benefit the body; if not, they cause illness." Moldy foods that contain mycotoxins should be avoided.

1. Individuals with excessive yang heat should avoid foods such as longan, lychee, and lamb, which are warming in nature. Instead, they should consume cooling foods.

2. People with a deficient and cold constitution should avoid cold and cooling foods such as watermelon, mung beans, and cucumbers. Instead, they should consume warming foods.

3. Individuals with yin deficiency should avoid spicy foods such as chili, garlic, and ginger. Instead, they should consume nourishing yin foods such as black fungus, black beans, black dates, black mulberry seeds, snow ear, watermelon (feng shui type), lotus root, and yam.

4. Consult a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner to determine your constitution and identify suitable foods. Regular follow-ups are recommended to adjust dietary choices appropriately.
