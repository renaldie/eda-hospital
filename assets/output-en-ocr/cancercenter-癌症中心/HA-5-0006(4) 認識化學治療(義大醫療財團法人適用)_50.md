## VIII. Understanding Chemotherapy Drug Extravasation

## I. What is Chemotherapy Drug Extravasation

It refers to the leakage of chemotherapy drugs from the intravenous injection site or intravenous catheter into the surrounding subcutaneous tissues, leading to tissue infiltration, blister formation, and local muscle tissue necrosis.

## II. Signs of Chemotherapy Drug Extravasation

Please immediately inform the medical or nursing staff if any of the following signs occur:

1. Pain, prickling sensation, or burning sensation at the injection site.

2. Redness or erythema at the injection site.

3. Leakage, swelling, or hard nodules at the injection site.

4. Absence of blood return or reduced flow rate in the infusion line.

## III. Skin Manifestations of Chemotherapy Extravasation

The skin manifestations of extravasation range from redness, heat, pain, and blisters to further skin ulceration and necrosis, potentially resulting in complications such as nerve damage, tissue contracture, and joint stiffness involving nerves and tendons.
