## Chemotherapy Patients - Nutritional Medicinal Foods

Chemotherapy patients often experience weakened immune function, gastrointestinal disturbances, suppression of hematopoietic function, and other physiological imbalances. In the concept of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) health care, seeking medicinal dietary supplements to improve patients' quality of life is an essential component of complementary therapies in both traditional and Western medicine.

During chemotherapy, patients commonly experience gastrointestinal reactions (such as nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite) and bone marrow suppression (such as reduced white blood cells and anemia). In dietary management, it is important to focus on stimulating appetite and consuming nutrient-rich foods.

It is recommended to consume foods that strengthen the spleen and stomach and nourish bones and marrow, such as: yam, job's tears, hawthorn, malt, citrus fruits, lion's mane mushroom, shiitake mushrooms, radish, eggs, and black fungus.

Additionally, foods that tonify qi and blood should be included, such as: red tea, goji berries, red beans, walnuts, lotus seeds, spinach, and longan meat. Avoid foods with strong fishy or pungent flavors.

## Characteristics of Chemotherapy Medicinal Foods

Combining food with medicinal herbs can promote physical health and also have preventive and therapeutic effects. Therefore, chemotherapy medicinal foods are also known as anti-cancer medicinal foods. The ingredients of chemotherapy medicinal foods consist of both food and traditional Chinese herbal medicines. Beyond improving taste, these components complement each other and enhance therapeutic efficacy.
