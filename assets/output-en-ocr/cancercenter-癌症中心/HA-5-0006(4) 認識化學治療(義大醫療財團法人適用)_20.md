## 【Instructions】

1. Wash the beef shank thoroughly. Cut the red and white radishes into large pieces, slice the onion in half, remove the outer skin of the garlic, and wash the green scallions before tying them up.

2. Prepare a pot with cold water (enough to cover the beef shank). Place the beef shank in the pot and boil over medium-high heat until it comes to a boil. Continue boiling for 3 more minutes, then turn off the heat, remove the beef shank, and rinse it under cold water to remove impurities.

3. Let the beef shank cool down until it is no longer hot, then cut it into slices or chunks.

4. Prepare a flavor pouch. Place ginger slices, bay leaf, eight-cornered spice, and Sichuan pepper into the pouch and seal the opening.

5. Place the beef shank, red and white radishes, onion, garlic, flavor pouch, green scallions, rice wine, and water (less water for a richer broth, more water for a lighter broth) into a deep pot. Put the pot into a rice cooker, place two cups of water in the outer pot, turn on the power, and let it cook until the power indicator light turns off. Then, add two more cups of water and continue cooking.

6. Remove the flavor pouch and green scallions before serving. Add salt to taste just before serving to complete the dish.
