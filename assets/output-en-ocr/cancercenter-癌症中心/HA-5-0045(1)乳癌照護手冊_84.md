## How to Improve Cancer Fatigue

According to the *Clinical Treatment Guidelines for Cancer-Related Fatigue*, the following five solutions are provided:

## Exercise

Set exercise content and intensity based on the patient's condition and preferences. Warm-up and cool-down exercises of 5 minutes each before and after exercise are essential.

## Psychological and Social Interventions and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

Psychological education and counseling can enhance patients' abilities to manage anxiety, depression, and psychological distress, thereby improving fatigue.

## Improve Sleep

Sleep therapy often requires medication assistance. Patients can request medication from healthcare providers based on their sleep conditions.

## Nutritional Management

Track one's nutritional status and discuss it with a dietitian as needed to supplement nutrition and prevent body supply-demand imbalance leading to fatigue.

## Complementary Therapies

Therapies such as massage and acupuncture can alleviate discomfort caused by fatigue. However, it is recommended to consult a doctor before using them.
