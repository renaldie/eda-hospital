## Manual Lymphatic Drainage

Purpose of manual lymphatic drainage:

Softens subcutaneous tissue, reduces protein deposition, improves subcutaneous fibrosis, promotes lateral lymphatic branching, and redirects stagnant lymph to normal, undamaged lymphatic territories.

Manual lymphatic drainage must be performed by a professionally trained therapist. Therefore, when lymphedema occurs, it is recommended to visit the rehabilitation department for evaluation by a physician, after which a physical therapist will carry out lymphatic drainage.
