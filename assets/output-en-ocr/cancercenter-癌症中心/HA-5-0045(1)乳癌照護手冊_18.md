## Drainage tube volume recording

Hospital nurses will provide you with a small measuring cup with graduations to record the volume and color of the drainage fluid. Please record the volume and color accurately, and then pour it down the toilet to flush it away. When you return for follow-up, please bring the registration form with you. Your doctor will use your records to decide whether to remove the drainage tube. If the drainage volume gradually decreases, the doctor will remove the drainage tube based on the wound healing condition.
