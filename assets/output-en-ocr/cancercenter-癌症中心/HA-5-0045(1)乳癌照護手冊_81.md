## Taiwan Version of the Brief Fatigue Scale Test

Simply think about the following three questions:

2. If yes, select a score from 0 to 10 (0 means completely not tired, 10 means the most fatigued state imaginable) to describe your daily fatigue level.

3. Does this fatigue affect your daily functioning (e.g., work, household chores)?

You can use the "Taiwan Version of the Brief Fatigue Scale Test" to help yourself understand the current status and impact of cancer-related fatigue.
