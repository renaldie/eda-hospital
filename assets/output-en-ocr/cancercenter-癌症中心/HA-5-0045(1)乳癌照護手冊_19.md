## Introduction to the Implantable Injection Port (Port-A)

## I. What is the Implantable Injection Port (Port-A):

Port-A (venous access implantable port, Port-A) is commonly known as an artificial vein. It is a synthetic silicone device composed of two parts: a spherical section and a catheter. It features an injection port and a catheter with a locking mechanism (Figure 1). The catheter is approximately 70 cm long (about 15–20 cm when implanted inside the body), extending from the subclavian vein through the superior vena cava to the upper part of the right atrium. The injection site is implanted into the subcutaneous tissue of the chest wall beneath the clavicle, thus not interfering with daily life. It appears as a small bump, roughly the size of a 10-yuan coin (Figure 2).

## II. How is the Implantable Injection Port (Port-A) installed:

Generally, patients can be admitted to the hospital or receive outpatient treatment under local or general anesthesia. A small incision of about 4–5 cm is made below the clavicle. The catheter is inserted into the central vein from a peripheral vein, and then the injection port is implanted beneath the skin.

## III. Why is the Implantable Injection Port (Port-A) installed and what are its benefits:

Patients receiving long-term chemotherapy often experience vein thrombosis or vein hardening, which increases the difficulty of injections and causes physical and psychological discomfort. If chemotherapy drugs accidentally leak, it may lead to local tissue and vascular necrosis.

The Port-A is specifically designed for patients requiring long-term and repeated drug administration. It eliminates the pain and inconvenience of repeated intravenous injections, making it both safe and convenient. It can be used for drug injections or continuous infusion, blood draws for laboratory testing, and even for the administration of blood products, nutrition, or other liquids.
