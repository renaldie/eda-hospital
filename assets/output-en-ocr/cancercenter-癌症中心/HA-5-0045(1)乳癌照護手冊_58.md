## Application of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Cancer Chemotherapy

In cancer treatment, chemotherapy drugs can directly inhibit or kill cancer cells. However, many chemotherapy drugs lack selectivity and cause damage to the body, leading to side effects such as those affecting the hematopoietic system, immune system, digestive system, and nervous system. Some drugs also exhibit delayed toxicities. According to the traditional Chinese medical principle of "strengthening the body's defenses and eliminating pathogenic factors," using herbal medicine to regulate the body can enhance therapeutic efficacy and reduce side effects.

## Dietary and Nutritional Guidance Principles for Cancer Patients in Traditional Chinese Medicine

Cancer patients should consume food that is easy to digest, nutritious, and light, avoiding excessive intake of rich or greasy foods. Breast cancer patients should avoid high-fat (especially animal fats) and high-animal-protein foods.

## Avoid Consuming Foods Containing Carcinogens

1. Unfresh or long-stored foods, as well as foods containing nitrites  
2. Moldy foods containing mycotoxins, such as grains and their processed products  
3. Smoked or barbecued foods  
4. Foods containing artificial food additives  
5. Crops grown with heavy pesticide use during cultivation

## Pay Attention to Protecting Spleen and Stomach Function

1. Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy can all damage the spleen and stomach  
2. Overeating or undereating can harm the spleen and stomach  
3. Large doses of prolonged use of bitter-cold traditional Chinese herbal medicines can also damage the spleen and stomach  

*For cancer patients, if spleen and stomach function decline (i.e., "stomach qi" weakens), it indicates significant treatment challenges. It is recommended to receive customized traditional Chinese medicine-based supportive care after treatment, which can help improve quality of life and treatment outcomes.*
