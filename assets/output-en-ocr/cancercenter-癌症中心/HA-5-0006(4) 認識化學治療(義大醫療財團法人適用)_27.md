## (5) Oral Ulcers

## ★ Dietary Principles and Improvement Methods:

1. Avoid stimulating foods such as alcoholic beverages, carbonated drinks, lemon juice, heavily seasoned spices (e.g., chili powder, black pepper, curry powder), pickled foods, and rough or hard foods (e.g., fried chicken, raw salad).

2. Choose soft and tender foods or chop and finely slice food to facilitate swallowing.

3. Use thickening agents or mix food with meat juice or meat broth to aid swallowing.

4. Use a juicer to blend fruits into a smooth paste for easier swallowing.

5. Rinse the mouth frequently to remove food residue and bacteria, maintaining hygiene to promote wound healing.

6. Eat through a straw to avoid touching the ulcer.

7. Consume high-calorie, protein-rich foods to support wound healing.

8. Choose soft, finely textured foods to assist chewing and swallowing,  
such as fruit milk, cheese, yogurt, and commercially available nutritional products.
