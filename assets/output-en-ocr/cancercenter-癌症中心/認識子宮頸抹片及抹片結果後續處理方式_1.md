## I. Introduction

Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers among women in our country. Studies have shown that cervical smear screening can reduce the incidence and mortality rates of invasive cervical cancer by 60–90%.

Our hospital has established a Cervical Smear Center on the second floor of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, offering a fast-track smear service with no appointment fees and no cost to patients. This service provides women with a private, confidential examination space and a convenient, comfortable examination process, aiming to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer and promote early detection and early treatment.

## II. Screening Eligibility

Women aged 30 or older who have had sexual intercourse should undergo a cervical smear examination once a year.

## III. Service Hours of the Cervical Smear Center

Monday to Friday:  
Morning: 08:30 – 11:30  
Afternoon: 13:30 – 16:30

## IV. Pre-Examination Precautions

1. Do not wash the vagina.  
2. Avoid soaking in a bath.  
3. Do not insert vaginal suppositories.  
4. Avoid sexual activity the night before the examination.  
5. Avoid the menstrual period.

## V. Examination Procedure

Cervical smear examination involves using a speculum (duck-bill device) to gently open the vagina, then using a small brush to collect shed epithelial cells from the cervix. These cells are smeared onto a slide for cytological examination.

## VI. Post-Report Handling

The cervical smear report will indicate "normal," "inflammation," "abnormal," or "indeterminate."

**Normal**  
Please undergo a cervical smear examination annually.

**Inflammation**  
If you experience discomfort in the perineal area, excessive discharge, or itching, it may be due to bacterial or fungal infection. Please return to the outpatient clinic for treatment as advised by your doctor.

**Abnormal**  
Please return to the outpatient clinic promptly for further evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and determine whether treatment is needed. Abnormal smears can be broadly categorized into:  
- Indeterminate atypical cells  
- Mild precancerous lesions  
- Severe precancerous lesions  
- Invasive cancer  

Your doctor will review your examination report and may recommend additional tests such as cervical smear, colposcopy, or human papillomavirus (HPV) testing. Please follow the doctor's recommendations for subsequent examinations.

**Indeterminate**  
Due to factors such as lack of hormones in the cervix, prior treatments, or other conditions, the collected sample may not be interpretable, resulting in a report labeled "indeterminate." Patients with an "indeterminate" result should return for a repeat examination. If the reason for indeterminacy is excessive inflammatory cells, please schedule an appointment at the outpatient clinic for a physician's evaluation. The doctor will then decide whether to repeat the smear or perform the test after treatment.

Please remember: every test carries a risk of false negatives. Even if the smear result is normal, you should seek medical attention if you experience any unusual symptoms.
