## Postoperative bras

Patients who undergo breast-conserving surgery can wear bras after surgery. If the incision is at the lower edge of the breast, it is recommended to wear sports bras without underwire. Patients who undergo total mastectomy, due to the presence of drainage tubes, should wear specialized postoperative bras.

For the first week after surgery, avoid pulling or tugging, and refrain from lifting or exerting force. Choose loose-fitting clothing with front closures or zippers.

In the initial phase after surgery, wear postoperative bras for 24 hours a day. Wear them for 3 to 6 months, after which they can be alternated with regular bras as a form of maintenance.

1. After surgery, get up and move around as soon as possible once conscious, but avoid falling or getting injured.

2. After surgery, perform deep breathing and coughing exercises to promote lung expansion and prevent respiratory complications.

3. When lying flat, use a pillow to elevate the affected arm above heart level to promote venous and lymphatic return, reducing swelling in the arm.

4. After suture removal, apply paper tape tightly for 1 to 3 months to enhance wound closure and provide support.

5. During chemotherapy or radiotherapy, the skin is more sensitive; avoid sun exposure. When going out during the day, wear long-sleeved clothing or use an umbrella to block direct sunlight.
