The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) provides seven recommendations for cancer patients to begin improving their fatigue issues by adjusting their lifestyle.

Try to remain physically active; walking is particularly suitable for cancer patients, and it's even better if you can develop a habit.
