## Care Guidelines for Radiation Therapy in Breast Cancer

Radiation therapy is an essential component of adjuvant treatment following breast cancer surgery. The principle of radiation therapy is to use high-energy X-rays or particle beams to destroy cancer cells, thereby reducing the risk of recurrence in the affected breast. Radiation therapy is typically administered once per day, five days a week, with each session lasting about five to ten minutes. The treatment course usually ranges from three to four weeks for shorter regimens, and up to five to six weeks for longer ones. Although there is no pain, warmth, or electric shock sensation during each treatment session, and the body does not retain any residual radioactivity, the skin in the treated area may gradually develop varying degrees of skin reactions known as radiation dermatitis.

## Generally, it is divided into four grades:

Grade 1: Mild localized redness and dry peeling.

Grade 2: Wider redness and small areas of moist peeling limited to skin folds.

Grade 3: Large areas of moist peeling appear outside the skin folds, possibly accompanied by bleeding.

Grade 4: Skin necrosis and ulceration, spontaneous bleeding, and potentially life-threatening complications.

Starting from the second or third week after treatment, the skin may gradually darken and become slightly red, similar to the changes caused by prolonged sun exposure. The acute skin inflammation caused by radiation is temporary and will gradually resolve within two to four weeks after the completion of therapy. Most skin reactions are mild, such as localized redness and peeling, while only a few patients experience more severe reactions.

Prevention is better than treatment, so how to alleviate radiation dermatitis is a key focus in radiation therapy. The primary principles of skin care during radiation therapy are to maintain cleanliness, preserve skin integrity, and promote comfort.
