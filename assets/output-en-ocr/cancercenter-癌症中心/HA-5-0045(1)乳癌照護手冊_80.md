## Difference from Ordinary Fatigue

Cancer-related fatigue is an abnormal or excessive state of generalized tiredness that cannot be relieved by sleep. Fatigue may be acute (lasting one month or less) or chronic (lasting one to six months or more). Regardless of duration, such fatigue often impacts patients' daily work and quality of life.
