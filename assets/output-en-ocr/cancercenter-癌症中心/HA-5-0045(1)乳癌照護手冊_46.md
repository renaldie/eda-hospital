## Principles of Care to Prevent Radiation Dermatitis

## (1) Maintain Skin Cleanliness

Keep the irradiated skin area clean and dry as much as possible. Avoid bathing, swimming, or soaking in hot springs. A shower with water below 40°C is sufficient. Use a soap or body wash specifically formulated for sensitive skin with a weakly acidic pH (4–6) and free from fragrances. Gently clean the irradiated skin area and pat it dry with a towel using light pressure, avoiding rubbing.

## (2) Maintain Skin Integrity

Avoid massaging the irradiated skin area or any rubbing, scratching, or rubbing motions. Do not apply adhesive bandages to the irradiated area.

Wear loose, soft clothing and avoid wearing bras to reduce skin friction. Avoid carrying bags on the affected side; instead, cross your arms over your chest to reduce friction in the armpit area.

Cover the treated area with clothing to prevent direct exposure to sunlight.

Avoid using razors to shave the area directly. Instead, use an electric shaver.

## (3) Promote Comfort

Reduce sweating to avoid skin irritation from sweat.

Avoid using baby powder or cornstarch in skin creases.

Avoid using skin products containing irritating ingredients such as alcohol, fragrances, or alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs).

Oily products such as petroleum jelly, baby oil, or sheep oil are difficult to clean and should be avoided during irradiation.

Antiperspirants containing or not containing metal components may be used if necessary.
