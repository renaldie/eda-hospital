A. Diarrhea  

(A) Pay attention to fluid and electrolyte replenishment. When experiencing diarrhea, you may appropriately consume sports drinks. In severe cases, intravenous infusion as prescribed by a doctor should be used for supplementation.  
(B) Eat small, frequent meals and choose low-fiber foods to avoid increasing intestinal motility and causing cramps, such as toast, white rice, noodles, fish, and skinless chicken. Avoid oily, spicy, and fried foods. If diarrhea is severe, switch to clear liquid diets, such as rice porridge or sports drinks.  
(C) Avoid foods that produce gas, such as leeks, legumes, dairy products, and dairy-based foods.

(F) If diarrhea does not improve, seek medical attention.
