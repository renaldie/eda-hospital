## Post-surgical lymphedema

Causes:  
1. Damage or dysfunction of lymphatic vessels or lymph nodes, leading to impaired transport capacity.  
2. Protein deposition in interstitial tissues, increasing tissue osmotic pressure, which makes water easily retained in the interstitial spaces.

Incidence: The incidence of lymphedema in the arm is 8.4%–21.4%.

## International Lymphatic Society Staging

| Stage | Symptoms | Management |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Stage 0 | Reduced transport capacity. | — |
| Stage I | Pitting edema present but reversible. | Elevate the limb, edema will subside |
| Stage IV | Elevating the limb is ineffective, with tissue fibrosis, skin thickening and hardening. | Comprehensive decongestive therapy |
| Stage III | Tissue inflammatory response, elephantiasis, decreased immunity, fungal infections between fingernails. | Surgery may be required |
