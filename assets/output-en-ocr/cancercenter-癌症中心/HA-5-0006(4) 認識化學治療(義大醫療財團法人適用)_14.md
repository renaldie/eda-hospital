## Four: Usage Method: [Patch]

1. Choose an appropriate area, clean it with clean water, and dry it thoroughly.

2. Remove the Durogesic patch packaging and protective film. Apply the patch and press it firmly with your palm for 30 seconds to ensure it adheres completely to the skin, especially at the edges of the patch (if you are concerned about it falling off, use transparent tape to reinforce the left and right sides).

3. Wash your hands with plain water only; do not use soap or any other cleaning agents. Record the time when the patch is applied.

4. After removing the used Durogesic patch, fold it over and place it back into the original packaging. Record the exact time of removal. When you return for your next appointment, bring the patch along with the record sheet to the pharmacy.
