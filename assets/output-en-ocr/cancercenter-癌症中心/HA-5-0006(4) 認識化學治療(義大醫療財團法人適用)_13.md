3. Activities are not restricted, but should avoid overly intense physical activities. For the arm on the same side as the artificial vascular graft, avoid full 360-degree rotation, lifting heavy objects, or direct impacts to prevent displacement of the graft.

4. If the artificial vascular graft is not in use, it is necessary to return for regular follow-up visits every 1 to 2 months or as advised by the doctor; after approval, visit the injection room to flush the catheter once with normal saline containing anticoagulant (heparin) to prevent catheter blockage.

5. Please pay attention to the blood return each time through the artificial vascular graft, as this provides important information for physicians or nurses to assess the function of the graft in the next visit.
