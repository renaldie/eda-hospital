## Caloric Requirements

☑ Underweight individuals (BMI < 18.5): 35–40 kcal per kilogram of body weight  
Normal weight individuals (18.5 ≤ BMI < 24): 35 kcal per kilogram of body weight  
Overweight individuals (BMI ≥ 24): 30 kcal per kilogram of body weight  

$ ^{*} $ BMI calculation = weight (kg) ÷ height $ ^{2} $ (m)

【Example Explanation】

A woman who is 158 cm tall and weighs 55 kg has a BMI of 55 ÷ (1.58) $ ^{2} $ = 22, which falls within the normal weight range. Therefore, her daily caloric requirement is: 55 × 35 = 1925 kcal.
