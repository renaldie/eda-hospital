## Two. Introduction and Overview of the Implantable Injection Port (Port-A)

## 1. What is the Implantable Injection Port (Port-A):

Port-A (venous access implantable port, Port-A) is commonly known as an artificial vein. It is a synthetic silicone device composed of two parts: a spherical body and a catheter. It features an injection port and a catheter with a locking mechanism (Figure 1). The catheter is approximately 70 cm long (about 15–20 cm when implanted inside the body), and it runs from the subclavian vein through the superior vena cava to the upper part of the right atrium. The injection site is implanted into the subcutaneous tissue of the chest wall beneath the clavicle, thus not interfering with normal daily activities. It appears as a small bump, roughly the size of a 10-yuan coin (Figure 2).

## 2. How to Install the Implantable Injection Port (Port-A):

Generally, patients can be scheduled for inpatient or outpatient procedures under local or general anesthesia performed by a surgeon. A small incision of about 4–5 cm is made below the clavicle, through which the catheter is inserted into the central vein from a peripheral vein, and then the injection port is implanted beneath the skin.
