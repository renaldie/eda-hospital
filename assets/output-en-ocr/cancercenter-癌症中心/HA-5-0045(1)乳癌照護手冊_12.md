### 2. Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous Flap (TRAM) Procedure

The TRAM procedure utilizes excess abdominal fat and abdominal wall tissue from the lower abdomen to reconstruct the breast, creating a natural-looking breast appearance. Compared to implant-based reconstruction, the TRAM procedure offers the advantage of providing sufficient soft tissue coverage for the chest.
