## Preoperative Lymphatic-Venous Anastomosis in Breast Cancer Surgery

A study published in 2017 in the *Annals of Surgical Oncology* reported that over a 10-year follow-up of 1,794 patients, the overall incidence of lymphedema following breast cancer surgery within five years was 9.1%. Among patients who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy, the incidence of lymphedema was 5.3%, whereas among those who underwent axillary lymph node dissection, it reached 15.9%. When radiotherapy was also administered, the risk increased by a factor of two.

With the advancement of surgical and medical techniques, breast cancer is becoming more prevalent among younger patients, yet cure rates remain high. Consequently, the number of patients developing lymphedema is also increasing.

In 2014, Dr. Boccardo from Italy published a study in an international journal, tracking 74 patients who underwent LYMPHA surgery during breast cancer treatment for four years. The incidence of lymphedema was reduced to 4.05%. In 2019, a study by Johnson and colleagues from Harvard Medical School compared the incidence of lymphedema across different stages with and without intraoperative LYMPHA:

a. Mastectomy + axillary lymph node dissection: lymphedema incidence of 14.1%.

b. Mastectomy + axillary lymph node dissection + radiotherapy-induced lymphedema: incidence of 33.4%.

c. Mastectomy + axillary lymph node dissection + LYMPHA: lymphedema incidence reduced to 2.1%.

d. Mastectomy + axillary lymph node dissection + radiotherapy + LYMPHA: lymphedema incidence reduced to 10.3%.

Literature confirms that this surgical approach is effective in preventing the occurrence of lymphedema.
