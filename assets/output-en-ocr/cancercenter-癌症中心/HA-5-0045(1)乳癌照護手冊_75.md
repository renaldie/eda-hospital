## Does eating too little nutrition cause tumors to grow faster?

## Is raw food diet better?

Most raw food diets emphasize raw foods (with high bacterial counts). During treatment, when white blood cell counts are low and immunity is weakened, individuals are more prone to diarrhea and infections. Raw food diets should be avoided during treatment.

## Cancer cells love sugar — avoid starch?

Natural foods contain "carbohydrates," which break down into glucose and fructose in the digestive system. These are the energy source for all cells in the body. Moderate intake of carbohydrate-rich foods, including whole grains, dairy, and fruits, is recommended. Avoid excessive intake of "refined sugars," which are added sugars used during food or beverage processing.
