## (Six) Dysphagia

★ Dietary principles and improvement methods:

1. Choose soft, finely chopped foods, and cook them with a thickening agent. Eating them alongside meat juice or meat broth can also help with swallowing.

2. Prepare meals using materials that increase food viscosity. For example: tapioca flour, sweet potato flour, or commercially available thickening agents.

3. Use liquid nutritional supplements or desserts such as pudding, brown rice milk, or noodle tea.

【Seasonings】  
coriander to taste, garlic paste to taste, black vinegar to taste, salad oil 2 tablespoons.

## 【Preparation Method】

1. Boil a pot of hot water, add the red rice noodles and briefly blanch them to remove any off-flavors attached to the noodles. After removing them, drain the noodles and cut them into pieces (about 10 cm long) using scissors or a knife. Set them aside for later use.

2. Soak the shrimp paste in water and drain it. In a flat pan, heat oil, then sauté garlic and shrimp paste. Add water/stock.

3. Add soy sauce, black vinegar, white pepper powder, salt, red onion paste, and crushed dried kelp to the pan. Once the mixture boils, add tapioca water gradually to thicken (add in portions to avoid making it too thick accidentally).

4. Then pour in the blanched and cut red rice noodles (about 10 cm long) previously prepared. Stir gently at this stage to prevent the noodles from sticking to the pan.

5. When the porridge is ready, top it with coriander, minced garlic, and a drizzle of black vinegar. Serve immediately.
