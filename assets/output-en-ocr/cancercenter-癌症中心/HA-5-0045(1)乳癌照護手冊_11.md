## 10 Breast Reconstruction Surgery in Plastic Surgery

## Special Features of Plastic Surgery Breast Reconstruction at the Cancer Treatment Hospital of Taichung

### 1. Latissimus Dorsi Myocutaneous Flap + Silicone Gel Implant Placement

After breast tissue removal, insufficient soft tissue often leads to capsule contracture when implants are placed, resulting in asymmetry between the two breasts in height or shape. The Plastic Surgery Department at the Cancer Treatment Hospital of Taichung has developed a technique using the latissimus dorsi muscle to supplement the deficient soft tissue of the breast, followed by placing the implant within the soft tissue envelope to achieve a soft, balanced, and symmetrical reconstructed breast.
