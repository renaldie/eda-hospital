## Dietary Restrictions (Abstaining from Certain Foods)

1. Cancer patients do not have strict dietary restrictions, but it is not recommended to consume "trigger foods."

2. What are "trigger foods"?

Refers to spicy, dry, hot, stimulating, rich, greasy, and heavy foods, as well as certain sea products.

Fowl, pig's head meat, lamb, shrimp, crab, mussels, tobacco, and alcohol can stimulate wind and heat, triggering chronic diseases, residual phlegm, sores, swellings, and epilepsy.

Shrimp, crab, and fish without scales are prone to causing allergic reactions.

3. Dietary restrictions should not be overly strict, and the diet should not be too narrow. It should be adjusted according to the strength of the spleen and stomach's digestive and absorptive functions, as well as the nature of the illness—whether it is cold, heat, deficiency, or excess—by providing appropriate food supplementation and dietary therapy.

## Dietary Recommendations

1. Reduce intake of animal saturated fats and omega-6 fatty acids (corn oil, soybean oil, and sunflower oil), and replace them with omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil and canola oil) and omega-9 fatty acids (olive oil, canola oil, bitter tea oil, and peanut oil).

2. Reduce consumption of red meat and prefer deep-sea fish instead.

3. Limit intake of full-fat dairy products and switch to low-fat or fat-free dairy products.

4. Increase consumption of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and nuts to enhance intake of dietary fiber, vitamins A, C, E, and carotenoids—antioxidants (dietary fiber helps eliminate female hormones in the body, reducing the concentration of female hormones in the blood).

5. Limit alcohol consumption.

6. Maintain regular sleep patterns and engage in regular physical activity.
