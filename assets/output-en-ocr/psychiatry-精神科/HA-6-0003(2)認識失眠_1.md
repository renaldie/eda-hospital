## Understanding Insomnia

## Introduction:

Do you often have difficulty sleeping? Do you always feel that going to bed at night is like a nightmare?

Have you ever tried any of the following when you can't sleep:

1. Drinking alcohol.  
2. Lying in bed for over an hour without being able to fall asleep.  
3. Taking sleep aids given by others or purchased from a pharmacy.  
4. Poor sleep quality, frequent awakenings, or waking up early, which in turn affects your mental state and mood the next day.

## Now, let the psychiatry team introduce you to the issue of insomnia:

Insomnia is a symptom, not a disease—just like fever or abdominal pain, it is only a sign of an underlying condition. It must be treated by identifying and addressing the root cause, rather than simply treating the symptoms, such as by taking sedatives or sleeping pills. If insomnia persists for over a year without proper treatment, it may lead to mental health disorders such as depression or anxiety.

## 1. Definition and Clinical Symptoms of Insomnia: This is a subjective complaint and can be divided into:

1. Insufficient sleep duration—sleeping less than before, not getting enough sleep time.  
2. Poor sleep quality—feeling unrested throughout the night or experiencing frequent dreams.

## 2. Diagnosis of Insomnia: Insomnia can be classified into three types, which may occur alone or in combination:

1. **Difficulty Falling Asleep**: Unable to fall asleep after lying in bed for over one hour.  
2. **Sleep Fragmentation**: Falls asleep quickly, but wakes up repeatedly during the night.  
3. **Early Waking**: Falls asleep quickly, but wakes up around 1–2 a.m.

## 3. Causes and Risk Factors of Insomnia:

1. **Psychological Factors**: Severe or chronic stress, such as anxiety about serious physical illnesses or surgery, the death of close family or friends, or severe mental health conditions like schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, or generalized anxiety disorder—all of which can lead to insomnia.

2. **Environmental Factors**: Environmental conditions during sleep, such as temperature, lighting, noise, comfort, jet lag, or changes in daily routines (e.g., night shifts), can all contribute to insomnia.

3. **Food Effects**: Alcohol, tea, coffee, soda, and medications with central nervous system stimulation can cause insomnia.

4. **Age-Related Factors**: As age increases, the body's sleep needs and sleep architecture change. Older adults tend to have shorter, more fragmented sleep compared to younger individuals who can typically sleep for eight hours at night.

5. **Physical Factors**: Conditions such as colds, pain, nocturia (frequent nighttime urination), sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can all contribute to insomnia.

6. **Lifestyle Factors**: Irregular sleep schedules, excessive daytime napping, inconsistent daily routines, lack of physical activity or labor, exposure to screens or blue light before bedtime, and eating too much before bed can all disrupt sleep.

## 4. Methods to Improve Sleep and Non-Pharmacological Treatments:

1. Aim for a sleep duration that leaves you feeling refreshed the next day. Avoid staying in bed too long, as prolonged sleep (light sleep or half-asleep states) may actually make it harder to sleep well the next day.

2. Avoid drinking coffee, tea, alcohol, or smoking before bedtime.

3. Establish a consistent sleep schedule—even on weekends or after retirement—just as you would during work or school hours.

4. Set up a comfortable sleeping environment with appropriate room temperature, lighting, and bedding. Minimize disturbances by avoiding activities such as watching TV, making phone calls, or discussing matters while lying in bed.

5. Engage in regular daytime physical activity and plan enjoyable activities. Avoid long naps or frequent short naps during the day. Avoid intense exercise close to bedtime.

6. Avoid eating too much or drinking too much before bed, as a full stomach or frequent nighttime urination can interfere with sleep. However, if you have gastrointestinal issues or stomach discomfort affecting your sleep, a small snack before bed may help (but avoid overeating).
