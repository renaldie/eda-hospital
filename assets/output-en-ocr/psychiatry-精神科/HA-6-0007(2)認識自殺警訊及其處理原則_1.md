Suicide is a major global public health issue, and Taiwan is no exception. In recent years, the general public has developed basic awareness regarding community suicide prevention and mental health. Clinically, suicide is a complex and multifactorial issue. Risk factors among individuals who attempt suicide include demographic, psychiatric, familial, social, and even cultural factors, making suicide risk and related prevention highly complicated. This implies the need for a tool (a screening scale) to objectively and rigorously assist healthcare professionals in assessing suicide risk. Disease is undoubtedly a key factor in suicide. Among individuals who die by suicide, 70–90% have mental disorders, with depression being the most common, followed by substance use disorders and schizophrenia. Among all individuals with depression, 15% ultimately die by suicide. Chronic physical illnesses such as cancer, asthma, heart disease, end-stage renal disease, and chronic intractable pain also increase the risk of depression and suicide, and thus require greater attention. Regarding suicide attempts, women are 2–3 times more likely than men. However, when it comes to suicide success rates, men are twice as likely as women. Suicide can be categorized into three age groups: the highest rate is among the elderly, particularly those over 70 years old; next is the middle-aged and young adults aged 35–50; and finally, adolescents aged 18–25. Suicide prevention requires the participation of all members of society. The "Ask, Respond, Referral" approach means that when you notice someone expressing thoughts of suicide or depression, you should show concern, respond to their feelings, and help refer them to professional medical personnel.

## How to Help a Friend with Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors?

1. Create a safe and warm environment, removing potentially dangerous items from the surroundings (such as knives, belts, lighters), and securely storing them—especially during times when family members may be less vigilant, such as early mornings or late nights.

2. Build a relationship: express willingness to discuss emotional issues or other topics, offer care and affection, listen patiently to the person’s pain, and help them feel that someone cares about them, understands them, and is willing to support them. Avoid dismissing or mocking what they say, and refrain from arguing with them.

3. Listen: individuals considering suicide most need someone to listen to their inner thoughts and feelings. This listening itself is a form of support. Encourage the person to express their emotions, allow appropriate expressions of anger, and let them know that you can accept their feelings. Do not treat death as a joke; do not trivialize the person’s wishes or emotions, or make dismissive comments.

4. If the situation is severe, encourage the person to seek medical treatment: when there is an immediate risk, do not abandon them. You may seek support from any available resource (such as those listed below) or from a trusted person, or call 110 for emergency assistance.
