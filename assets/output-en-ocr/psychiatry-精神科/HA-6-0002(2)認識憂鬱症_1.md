2. When visiting the doctor, please describe changes in symptoms and daily routines. Feel free to discuss any concerns with the doctor.  
3. Please continue treatment as prescribed—take medication regularly, attend follow-up appointments, and do not adjust medication dosage or discontinue treatment on your own.  
4. Symptoms of depression usually begin to improve within weeks of starting treatment. With consistent follow-ups and regular medication, optimal treatment outcomes should be achieved within six months. However, since depression may relapse after stopping medication, it is generally recommended to continue treatment for at least one year.
