7. Do not force yourself to fall asleep. If you are still unable to fall asleep after lying down for over thirty minutes, get up and engage in some gentle activities (such as reading) until you feel like going to sleep again.

Five. Do you need help?

If, within the next month, your sleep problems occur repeatedly, or if they have already affected your daily life and work, you should consider seeking medical consultation.

If you have any questions, please feel free to consult our hospital's psychiatry outpatient department.
