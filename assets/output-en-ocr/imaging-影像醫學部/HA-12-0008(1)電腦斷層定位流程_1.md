After the fixed mold has cooled down, before the CT scan, the nursing staff will inject a contrast agent. The contrast agent itself is warm, so it is normal to feel a warm sensation after it is injected into the body. Once positioning is complete, if there is no discomfort in the body, you can ask the nursing staff to remove the needle (the needle site is where the injection was made). If there are no other fasting requirements for the examination, drinking more water will help eliminate the contrast agent from your body. Your subsequent treatment schedule will be notified by phone.

## Notes

The radiographer will draw black lines and marks on your body, which are used for positioning and posture correction before radiation therapy, not for the actual treatment site. Please be careful when bathing! You can rinse with plain water, but do not use soap or scrub vigorously. If the black lines disappear, do not draw them yourself; instead, wait until your treatment session and have the radiographer handle it.
