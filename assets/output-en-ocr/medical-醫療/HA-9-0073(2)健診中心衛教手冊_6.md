## Diet for Hyperlipidemia

Hyperlipidemia refers to increased cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood. Abnormal lipid levels (hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, or both) are the primary cause of atherosclerosis, increasing the risk of coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular diseases.

| Lipid Type                  | Standard Range       | Borderline High Level | High Level         |
|----------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| Total cholesterol (non-fasting) | < 200 mg/dL         | 200–239 mg/dL          | ≥ 240 mg/dL        |
| LDL cholesterol (fasting 12 hours) | < 140 mg/dL         | 140–159 mg/dL          | ≥ 160 mg/dL        |
| Triglycerides (fasting 12 hours) | < 150 mg/dL         | 150–400 mg/dL          | > 400 mg/dL        |

## Part I: Diet for Hypercholesterolemia

## 1. Maintain an ideal body weight.

2. Limit intake of foods high in cholesterol, such as internal organs (brain, liver, kidneys), crab roe, shrimp roe, fish roe, etc. If blood cholesterol is elevated, limit egg yolks to no more than 2–3 per week.

3. Reduce intake of foods high in saturated fat. Animal-based foods: fatty meats, full-fat dairy, butter, lard, tallow, etc. Plant-based foods: roasted coconut oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, etc.

4. Use plant oils rich in monounsaturated fatty acids for cooking, such as peanut oil, rapeseed oil, olive oil, etc.

5. Adopt low-fat cooking methods, such as steaming, boiling, roasting, stewing, pickling, braising, stir-frying, or cold-dressing. Reduce consumption of meat skin (pork skin, duck skin, chicken skin, fish skin), to minimize fat intake.

6. Choose fiber-rich foods, such as various vegetables and fruits, unprocessed legumes, whole grains, etc.

7. Moderately consume foods rich in natural antioxidants (such as polyphenols, vitamin C, carotenoids, isoflavones), such as fruits and vegetables, green tea, to enhance vascular antioxidant function.

8. Adjust lifestyle habits: quit smoking, limit alcohol consumption, engage in moderate physical activity, and manage stress.
