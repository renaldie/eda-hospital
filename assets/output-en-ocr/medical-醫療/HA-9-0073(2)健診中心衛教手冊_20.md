A 1-minute osteoporosis risk assessment with 19 simple questions to help you better understand your bone health (Source: The Osteoporosis Society of the Republic of China)

$^{*}$ Note 1: Body Mass Index (BMI) calculation method = (weight in kilograms) / (height in meters × height in meters)

| Question | Yes | No |
|---------|-----|----|
| **Family History** | | |
| 1 | Parents have been diagnosed with osteoporosis or have fractured after a minor fall? | |
| 2 | One parent has a hunched back (kyphosis)? | |
| **Personal Factors** (inborn and unchangeable factors) Understanding these risk factors is important to reduce the occurrence of bone loss!) | | |
| 3 | Are you over 40 years old? | |
| 4 | Have you ever fractured due to a fall after adulthood? | |
| 5 | Do you frequently fall (more than once in the past year), or are you worried about falling due to weakness? | |
| 6 | Has your height decreased by more than 3 cm since your 40s? | |
| 7 | Are you underweight? (BMI less than 19) [Note 1] | |
| 8 | Have you taken steroid medications (e.g., prednisone, dexamethasone) continuously for more than 3 months? (Prednisone is commonly used to treat asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and certain inflammatory conditions) | |
| 9 | Do you have rheumatoid arthritis? | |
| 10 | Have you been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism or hyperparathyroidism? | |
| **Women, please continue answering the following questions** | | |
| 11 | Have you experienced menopause before age 45? | |
| 12 | Have you stopped menstruating for more than 12 months, apart from pregnancy, menopause, or removal of the uterus? | |
| 13 | Have you had your ovaries removed before age 50 without hormone replacement therapy? | |
| **Men, please continue answering the following questions** | | |
| 14 | Have you experienced symptoms of low testosterone such as erectile dysfunction or loss of libido? | |
| **Lifestyle Factors** (You can modify your lifestyle to reduce risks associated with diet and lifestyle) | | |
| 15 | Do you consume more than two standard alcoholic drinks per day? [Note 2] | |
| 16 | Do you have a long-term smoking habit, or have you ever smoked? | |
| 17 | Do you engage in less than 30 minutes of physical activity daily (including household chores, walking, running, etc.)? | |
| 18 | Do you avoid dairy products and do not take calcium supplements? | |
| 19 | Do you spend less than 10 minutes outdoors daily and do not take vitamin D supplements? | |
| If you answered "yes" to any of the above questions, it does not mean you have osteoporosis. It only indicates that you have more risk factors for osteoporosis, and thus a higher risk of developing the condition. We recommend discussing this questionnaire with a specialist doctor and undergoing further bone density testing at a hospital. |

| Obesity | Overweight | Normal | Underweight |
|--------|------------|--------|-------------|
| Over 30 | 25–29.9 | 18.5–24.9 | Below 18.5 |

## Part II: Store Your Bone Health Early—Prevention Is Key. Maintain a Balanced Diet and Exercise Routine to Build Strong Bones and Live Healthily into Old Age

1. Before the age of 20, it is the golden period for building and storing "bone stock." Develop good habits—exercise regularly, avoid smoking and drinking alcohol, and limit excessive consumption of caffeine-containing beverages such as coffee, soda, and strong tea. This helps strengthen bones and build up your "bone stock."

2. During middle age, especially after menopause in women, increase intake of calcium-rich foods such as fish, shrimp, milk, soy products, and green vegetables. Reduce consumption of overly sweet foods, and limit intake of high-salt and high-protein foods. If necessary, follow your doctor’s advice to take calcium supplements.

3. Establish a regular exercise routine. Exposure to sunlight helps the body produce vitamin D, which enhances calcium absorption. For older adults, regular and moderate activities such as walking, light jogging, or cycling are more suitable.

4. Middle-aged and older adults are at high risk for osteoporosis. If diagnosed with osteoporosis, do not panic or self-medicate with unverified over-the-counter remedies. Instead, work closely with your doctor for proper treatment to ensure bone health.

5. Improve home safety by enhancing indoor lighting, installing handrails on stairs, and ensuring slip-resistant flooring in bathrooms and kitchens to prevent falls and fractures.
