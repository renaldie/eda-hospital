## 01 Natural Disasters

In the event of natural disasters such as typhoons, if the Kaohsiung and Hsinchu areas announce a closure of operations on the day of the health check-up, for safety reasons, all health check-up services will be temporarily suspended. Subsequent scheduling will be arranged by dedicated personnel. Enterprise clients are advised to contact the designated officer for further arrangements!
