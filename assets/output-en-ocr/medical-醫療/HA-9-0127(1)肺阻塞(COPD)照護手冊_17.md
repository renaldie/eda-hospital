## Grip Ball (or Hand Grip Exercise)

## YouTube

Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterized by a decline in muscle mass, strength, and function throughout the body. Studies have found that approximately 27% of COPD patients have sarcopenia.  
Hand grip strength not only reflects hand muscle strength but also serves as the best indicator of overall muscle strength.

COPD patients with low grip strength and reduced skeletal and respiratory muscle function are at increased risk of acute exacerbations and mortality, leading to deterioration of lung function and reduced quality of life.  
Studies show that for every 1 kg decrease in grip strength, the risk of COPD worsening increases by 5%.
