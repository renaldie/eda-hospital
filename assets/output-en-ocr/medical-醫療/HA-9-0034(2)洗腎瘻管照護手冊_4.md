## ☑ Important Notes for Patients

1. The puncture site of the dialysis catheter should be kept clean at all times to prevent infection.

2. After performing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), compression hemostasis will continue for 2 hours, and it is recommended that patients remain at the hospital during this time for observation until the catheter hemostasis has improved before leaving.

3. After dialysis, the dialysis catheter should be properly hemostasized, and prolonged compression with a pressure band should be avoided as much as possible.

4. It is recommended to rotate puncture sites during dialysis to extend the lifespan of the catheter.

5. Avoid puncturing at sites with vascular malformations, hard lumps, or bruises.

6. Follow medical instructions and actively perform fist clenching exercises to expand the dialysis catheter in the arms.

7. Avoid sleeping on the side to prevent long-term compression on the catheter.
