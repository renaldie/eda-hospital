## Notes:

(1) Change position every two hours and check for pressure sores on the pressure-bearing side.

(2) If there is hydrocephalus, head surgery, or fracture site, adjust the position according to medical instructions.

(3) For patients using a respirator or urinary catheter, ensure that pulling does not occur.
