## II. Indications for Radiotherapy

| Treatment Type | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| Curative radiotherapy | Nasopharyngeal cancer, early laryngeal cancer, prostate cancer; patients with early-stage cancers who are not suitable for surgery can also achieve curative outcomes using stereotactic radiotherapy. |
| Preoperative radiotherapy | To reduce tumor invasion extent: for example, esophageal cancer and colorectal cancer. |
| Postoperative radiotherapy | To reduce the risk of local recurrence: for example, breast cancer, head and neck cancers, and high-risk groups after surgery for pelvic or abdominal tumors. |
| Cancer with metastasis (few metastatic sites/locations)/Stage IV cancer patients who experience occasional deterioration at specific sites after receiving systemic chemotherapy or immunotherapy targeting therapy | Local radiotherapy can be used to manage these deteriorating lesions, thereby improving the patient's quality of life or survival rate. |
| Palliative care | To alleviate symptoms caused by tumors, such as bone pain, airway compression, venous compression leading to edema in upper or lower extremities, or neurological symptoms caused by brain or spinal cord tumors, thus improving the patient's quality of life. |
