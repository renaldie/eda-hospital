## Five. Non-pharmacological Treatment for Lung Obstruction

## Smoking Cessation and Vaccination

## Smoking Cessation

Tobacco contains over 7,000 chemicals,  
of which hundreds are toxic, and at least 93 are known carcinogens.  

Smoking is the leading risk factor for lung obstruction, leading to deterioration of lung function, reduced quality of life, and is associated with many of the top ten causes of death (such as malaria, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, etc.).

## According to statistical data:

Smokers are 25 times more likely to develop lung cancer than non-smokers, and smokers with lung obstruction are 120 times more likely to develop it.
