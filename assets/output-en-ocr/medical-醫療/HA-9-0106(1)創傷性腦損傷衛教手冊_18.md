## Seven. Symptoms (continued)

## (2) Partial Seizures

When a discharge starts in one part of the brain and consciousness remains intact, it is called a "simple partial seizure." As the discharge gradually spreads to other parts of the brain and eventually involves the entire brain, resulting in loss of consciousness, it is known as a "complex partial seizure." If the discharge continues to spread, it may lead to a grand mal seizure.

During the complex partial seizure phase, patients often appear dazed for about 1 to 2 minutes. At this time, they may exhibit strange, aimless movements, such as biting the lips, licking the lips, grabbing at fingers, touching things randomly, removing their clothes, talking, walking in circles, crying, or laughing.
