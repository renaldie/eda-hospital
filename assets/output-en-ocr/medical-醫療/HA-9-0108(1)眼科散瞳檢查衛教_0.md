# Ophthalmic Dilation Education

## 1. Definition of Dilation (Pupil Enlargement):

Administering dilation drops to paralyze the ciliary muscle, thereby enlarging the pupils. This enables more detailed examinations of cataracts, the retina (including vitreous body, macula, and optic nerve), and vision screening in children.

## 2. Procedure of Dilation:

<td style='text-align: center;'>One drop is sufficient; the time required for pupil dilation is approximately 30 minutes. However, due to individual differences, a few individuals may require 2–3 applications to achieve effective dilation.</td>

<td style='text-align: center;'>For children under 16 years old, due to stronger ciliary muscle contraction, three applications every 10 minutes are required to achieve optimal dilation.</td>

## 3. Post-Dilation Precautions:

1. After pupil dilation, temporary symptoms such as blurred vision, difficulty reading, and light sensitivity may occur. Therefore, avoid driving or riding a bike on the same day to prevent accidents.

2. Normal vision typically returns within 4–6 hours after dilation. In some patients, it may take 6–12 hours to fully recover. Be cautious when walking or going up and down stairs to avoid falls.

3. Bring your own sun protection tools such as sunglasses, hats, or umbrellas to reduce discomfort from light sensitivity.

## 4. Fall Prevention Mnemonic:

1. Use assistive devices to prevent falls  
2. Be cautious when changing positions  
3. Have family members accompany you to prevent falls  
4. Ask for help whenever needed  
5. Collaborate with medical staff to prevent falls
