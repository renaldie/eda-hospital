## Health insurance coverage

Preoperative evaluation and surgery for living kidney transplant recipients are covered by insurance, and patients only need to bear certain out-of-pocket expenses (such as additional ward fees or meal costs).

## Living kidney transplantation with blood type incompatibility or positive cross-match

Previously, living donor kidney transplants were not possible due to blood type incompatibility or a positive cross-match between recipient and donor. Currently, recipients must undergo plasmapheresis and immunosuppressive drug therapy prior to surgery to improve their condition. Whether to undergo splenectomy will be decided after medical evaluation. The entire transplantation process and related issues should be thoroughly discussed with a physician.
