## Importance of Breathing Training

1. Chronic inflammation of the airways leads to airway obstruction, potentially causing dynamic overinflation of the lungs and limiting patients' physical activity capacity.

2. Breathing training increases expiratory time, reducing gas retention in the lungs and helping to reduce dynamic overinflation during exercise, thereby improving patients' breathing difficulties.

3. Expiratory Positive Pressure (PEP) devices are adjustable breathing training tools that use a set resistance to maintain a positive pressure state during exhalation. When combined with diaphragmatic relaxation and abdominal muscle engagement, PEP helps prevent airway collapse during exhalation, improves gas retention in the thoracic cavity, and aids in the clearance of respiratory secretions.
