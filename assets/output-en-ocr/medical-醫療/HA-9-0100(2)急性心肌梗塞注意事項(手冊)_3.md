### 5. Hypertension:

Elevated blood pressure makes it easier to damage the stability of endothelial cells within blood vessels, allowing cholesterol to enter the vessel walls and form atherosclerotic plaques that block blood flow.

### 6. Diabetes:

It increases oxidative stress in coronary arteries and insulin resistance. Under high glucose conditions, plaques are more likely to accumulate within blood vessels. People with diabetes have a two-fold increased risk of developing ischemic heart disease.

### 7. Overweight or obesity:

Being overweight or obese can lead to elevated blood pressure, high lipid levels, and diabetes, all of which can trigger ischemic heart disease.

### 8. Lack of physical activity (sedentary lifestyle):

Lack of physical activity increases the risk of ischemic heart disease by about two times, and also worsens other risk factors.

### 9. Unbalanced diet:

If dietary intake primarily consists of foods high in saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol, it easily leads to ischemic heart disease.

## Four. Types and Methods of Treatment:

### 1. Coronary Angioplasty:

Using catheters, a catheter is inserted through the femoral artery (or the radial artery in the upper limb). A catheter with a wire is then guided to the narrowed portion of the coronary artery, where the balloon is inflated to apply pressure and expand the blocked area, thereby increasing blood flow. Alternatively, a coronary artery stent can be delivered via catheter to the narrowed region of the coronary artery, achieving better results.

### 2. Thrombectomy:

During emergency catheterization, if a large amount of thrombus is detected, a "thrombectomy" procedure can be performed to remove the clot. The purpose is to prevent embolization of small distal vessels and the resulting inadequate perfusion of myocardial cells in the vascular supply zones, and to further reduce the area of myocardial cell necrosis.

### 3. Coronary Stent Placement:

During coronary angioplasty, the physician may choose to place a stent—a balloon catheter carrying a metallic stent—at the site of vascular narrowing in the patient, to prevent the vessel from re-blocking. Stents are divided into conventional metallic stents and drug-coated stents.
