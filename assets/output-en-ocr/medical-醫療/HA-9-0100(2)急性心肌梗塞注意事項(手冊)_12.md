6. Prioritize unprocessed soy products (such as soy milk, tofu, and bean curd), fish, and egg-based proteins, and reduce intake of red meat; consume deep-sea fish 1–2 times per week, such as salmon, sardines, and cod, which are rich in omega-3 fatty acids and help enhance vascular anti-inflammatory capacity.

7. Consume two bowls of fresh vegetables and two bowls of fruit daily to supplement natural antioxidant foods (such as polyphenols, vitamins, isoflavones, and carotenoids), thereby strengthening vascular antioxidant capacity.

8. Avoid fried foods; when making pickled meat or stewed soups, remove the top layer of fat after refrigerating before consumption.

9. Use plant-based oils for cooking, such as kukui nut oil, soybean salad oil, and olive oil; avoid artificially produced oils or animal fats.

10. Quit smoking and drinking alcohol.
