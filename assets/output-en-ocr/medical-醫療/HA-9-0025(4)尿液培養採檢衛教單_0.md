# Urine Culture Collection Instruction Sheet

One. Test Item: Aerobic Culture (Urine)

Two. Pre-collection Instructions: During the collection of urine, do not insert your hand into the container, and ensure the urine does not overflow beyond the container, as this may lead to contamination.

## Three. Collection Procedure:

1. First, open the lid of the sterile container, discard the initial portion of urine, then collect approximately one-third of the container (at least 5 c.c.) of midstream urine using a sterile container. Immediately close and secure the lid. Do not first urinate into another container before transferring it into the sterile urine cup.

2. For infants and young children, a urine bag may be used, but only one void should be collected—storage of urine is not allowed. Before attaching the urine bag, clean the labia or urethral opening. After collection, transfer the urine into a sterile container (at least 1 c.c.), then immediately close and secure the lid.

## Four. Post-collection Instructions:

1. After urine collection, the specimen should be delivered to the medical laboratory department/section reception window within one hour at room temperature to avoid changes in urine components and bacterial growth.

2. If immediate testing is not possible, store the specimen in a refrigerator and deliver it within two hours.
