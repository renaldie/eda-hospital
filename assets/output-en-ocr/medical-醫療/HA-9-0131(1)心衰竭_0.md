Trans fats, cholesterol, sodium, red meat, sweets, and sugary drinks.

4. Fluid intake should be controlled to 1200–1500 cc/day based on the severity of the condition to avoid worsening cardiac workload.

5. It is recommended to maintain an ideal body weight, and to weigh oneself daily (at the same time every morning). If daily weight increases by 0.5–1 kg, attention should be paid to urine output and fluid intake should be restricted.

## (Three) Self-care Guidelines

1. Avoid straining during bowel movements, as this may increase cardiac burden. If bowel movements are difficult, consume high-fiber foods or take softening medications as prescribed by your doctor.

2. Avoid sudden temperature changes, extreme temperature differences, or poor air quality environments, such as going from a warm bath to an air-conditioned room. Pay attention to staying warm and prevent catching a cold.

3. Monitor for signs of recurrence: if symptoms such as shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, abdominal distension, lower limb edema, or inability to lie in a semi-reclining position occur, seek medical attention immediately.

4. Take medications as prescribed by your doctor. Do not adjust or stop medication without medical advice. After discharge, take medications regularly and attend follow-up appointments as scheduled.

5. Quit smoking and avoid secondhand smoke: smoking is a risk factor for coronary artery disease and should be completely avoided to prevent increased cardiac workload.

6. Limit or avoid alcohol consumption.
