## What are gallstones?

## I. Introduction:

Gallstones are a common disease and can become a serious health concern.

## II. Classification:

The exact cause of gallstone formation is still unclear. Gallstones are generally classified into two types: pigment stones and cholesterol stones. In Taiwan, most gallstones are pigment stones, accounting for over 60%.

## III. Causes of cholesterol gallstones:

1. Genetics: The incidence varies among different ethnic groups. For example, up to 80% of adult Peruvian Indian women have cholesterol gallstones, which is significantly higher than in Eastern populations.

2. Gender: Adult women have a higher incidence than men of the same age group.

3. Age: The incidence increases with age.

4. Pregnancy: During pregnancy, the saturation of bile increases, and the physiological effects of female hormones make gallstone formation more likely.

5. Medications: Long-term use of oral contraceptives and postmenopausal hormone therapy significantly increase the risk of gallstone formation.

6. Obesity: Obese patients have higher cholesterol concentrations and increased secretion in bile, as well as higher cholesterol synthesis, making them more prone to gallstone formation.

7. Diabetes: Diabetic patients are more likely to develop gallstones, often due to excessive cholesterol secretion and impaired gallbladder motility.

8. Pancreatic disease: This results from poor digestion and absorption of bile salts.

9. Post-gastrointestinal surgery: Certain congenital malabsorption disorders and inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease, may lead to impaired bile salt reabsorption after surgical resection, thereby increasing the risk of gallstone formation.

10. Dietary habits: Diets high in calories and fatty foods are more likely to cause cholesterol gallstones.

## IV. Complications:

Obstruction of the cystic duct can lead to biliary colic, acute cholecystitis, cholangitis, gallbladder rupture, peritonitis, sepsis, and intestinal obstruction due to gallstones. Biliary obstructive jaundice, cholangitis, cholelithiasis-induced pancreatitis, biliary stricture, sepsis, and the possibility of cholangiocarcinoma arising from chronic cholecystitis have also been reported.

## V. Diagnosis:

In addition to clinical symptoms, abdominal ultrasound is the most convenient and highly accurate (over 95%) diagnostic tool. CT scans or retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) may be used as needed for further diagnosis.

## VI. Treatment:

1. Pain relief: This is the primary consideration. Smooth muscle relaxants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and opioid analgesics are effective; however, morphine is not recommended, as it can cause spasm of the Oddi sphincter, increasing biliary pressure and worsening pain.

2. Cholecystectomy is the most effective treatment for gallstones in the gallbladder.

3. Litholysis therapy is an alternative method for treating cholesterol gallstones.
