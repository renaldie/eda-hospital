The first 72 hours after injury are the most critical observation period. If any of the following local neurological symptoms occur at the time of injury or after discharge, emergency medical care should be sought immediately:

- Drowsiness, even unresponsive to calls; altered consciousness; behavior changes different from that at discharge

- Severe headache, dizziness, and persistent vomiting

- Seizures or convulsions in the limbs

- Sudden weakness or abnormal sensation on one side of the body, slurred speech

- Discharge or bleeding from the ears or nose

- Blurred vision, diplopia (seeing double, with overlapping images)
