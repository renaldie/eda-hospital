The radiographer will give you a button controller. Please hold it and continuously press the sensor button. When you press the button, the line on the screen will turn blue.

Then follow the voice instructions from the radiographer. When we say, "It's time to begin—please start deep breathing. As you inhale, the blue line on the screen will rise until it reaches the preset value (green zone). At that point, the machine will automatically block the breathing tube to help you hold your breath, and a number in the lower right corner will begin counting down. Once the number reaches zero, you may breathe normally.

If you experience any discomfort during the breath-holding process, simply release the button on the controller or exhale to resume normal breathing. Additionally, during the first time you are in the CT localization room to create a mold, if you experience any discomfort or find it difficult to synchronize with the breath-holding time using the respiratory control system, please immediately inform the radiographer so they can assist you in adjusting the settings.
