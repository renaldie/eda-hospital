## Three. Radiotherapy Process (2/2)

Note 1: Through outpatient visits or consultation pathways, physicians will analyze the patient's condition to determine whether radiotherapy is needed and what treatment approach should be adopted.

Note 2: To ensure consistent treatment quality, a custom treatment positioning mold will be fabricated in the simulation room prior to treatment. A CT scan will be performed under the treatment posture, allowing physicians and medical physicists to plan the subsequent treatment protocol. For special treatment methods, additional time will be required to verify suitability.

Note 3: The treatment plan design consists of two steps:

(1) The physician selects the treatment area and critical organs on imaging and plans the radiation dosage.

(2) The medical physicist designs one or multiple treatment plans based on the physician's requirements using the treatment planning system, allowing the physician to choose the most favorable option for the patient. Due to individual variations in treatment positions or repeated irradiation cases, this step requires more time.

Note 4: After the treatment plan is finalized, the nursing staff in this department will notify the patient or family that treatment can begin. Treatment duration varies from several minutes to half an hour, depending on the number of treatment sites or the complexity of the treatment method. Please patiently wait for your turn in the waiting area while other patients are undergoing treatment.
