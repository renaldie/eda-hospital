(7) If there are no special contraindications, normal diet can be resumed after returning to the ward.

(8) On the day of the check-up in the morning, the dressing will be removed by nursing staff, and the wound will be disinfected, then covered with gauze and waterproof film. If no discomfort is experienced, the gauze can be removed the next day, and the nurse will check for bruising around the wound and inform the physician. The skin bruising will gradually fade over approximately two to three weeks.
