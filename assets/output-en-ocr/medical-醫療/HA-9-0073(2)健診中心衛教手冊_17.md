## Understanding Osteoarthritis

## I. What is Osteoarthritis?

Osteoarthritis is a joint disease caused by mechanical damage to the joints, leading to degeneration of the synovial joints, resulting in pain and joint deformity.

## II. Causes:

1. Joints injured by external force.  
2. Related to genetics, race, obesity, occupation, age, aging, and osteoporosis.  
3. Normal cartilage is damaged due to long-term, repetitive joint movements and improper pressure.  
4. Congenital defects in cartilage.

## III. Symptoms:

1. Pain.  
2. Joint stiffness.  
3. Limited joint mobility.  
4. A "cracking" sound when moving the joint.  
5. Joint deformity.  
6. Joint swelling.

## IV. Diagnosis and Examinations:

1. X-ray examination: The most commonly used method, but it cannot detect early or mild cases.  
2. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): Particularly effective for early diagnosis of cartilage integrity.  
3. Physical examination: Can assess whether the joint is deformed or unstable.  
4. Arthroscopic surgery examination.

## V. Treatment Methods:

1. Apply ice during acute episodes to reduce swelling and relieve pain.  
2. Use heat therapy for chronic joint pain to help relieve discomfort.  
3. Isotonic and isometric exercises can improve circulation and muscle tension, preventing limited movement in the future.  
   (a) Isometric exercises refer to various muscle training.  
   (b) Isotonic exercises, such as jogging, swimming, cycling, or aerobic dance; however, hiking is not suitable for patients with osteoarthritis.  
4. Take medications as prescribed by a doctor, such as pain relievers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or joint cavity injections.  
5. When medications and rehabilitation are ineffective, surgery may be considered.  
6. Maintain a healthy body weight: Obese individuals have greater load on their knee joints, leading to more severe joint wear and thus a higher incidence of the disease.

## VI. Daily Care:

1. Maintain good posture whether sitting or standing, and avoid spinal twisting.  
2. Allow joints adequate rest and avoid overuse.  
3. Avoid sudden or rapid joint movements.  
4. Prefer using large joints rather than small ones to reduce load.  
5. When performing heavy and light tasks, alternate between them and do not complete all heavy tasks at once.  
6. Use appropriate supportive devices, such as knee braces, etc.
