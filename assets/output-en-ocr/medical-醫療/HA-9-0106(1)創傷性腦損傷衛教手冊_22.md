## Initial Care Guidelines After Injury

(1) Rest in bed with the head of the bed elevated 30–45 degrees.

(2) Closely monitor changes in consciousness within the first 3 days; avoid excessive mental activity or staring at TV or smartphone screens. Avoid intense physical activity for one week.

(3) Avoid stimulating foods such as spicy foods, coffee, alcohol, and smoking.

(4) Prevent constipation and follow the doctor's instructions for using stool softeners to prevent increased intracranial pressure due to straining during bowel movements. If the patient has not had a bowel movement for three days, inform the doctor.

(5) Do not self-administer sedatives, sleeping pills, or other medications without medical advice, as this may lead to misjudgment of the condition. If taking anticoagulants such as aspirin, inform the doctor to assess whether to temporarily discontinue use.
