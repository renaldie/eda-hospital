## (二) Local brain injury (continued)

## Three. Traumatic intracranial hemorrhage

- Brain tissue damage due to trauma causes blood vessel rupture and bleeding, resulting in hematoma formation. If no intracranial hemorrhage is detected initially, but intracranial hemorrhage is found on CT scan after several hours to two weeks, it is referred to as delayed intracranial hemorrhage.

• Symptoms: Edema around the hematoma leads to increased intracranial pressure, causing severe headache, drowsiness or confusion, nausea and vomiting, and seizures.

## Four. Subdural hemorrhage

- Blood accumulates in the space between the dura mater and arachnoid mater, often occurring in conjunction with intracranial hemorrhage.
