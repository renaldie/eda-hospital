## Dietary Principles

1. Avoid obesity and maintain a healthy body weight.

2. Eat meals at regular times and in fixed portions.

3. Limit intake of fried, pan-fried, or deep-fried foods, as well as skin from pork, chicken, duck, and fish, which are high in fat. Nuts such as peanuts, sesame seeds, walnuts, almonds, and cashews should be consumed in moderation due to their high fat and calorie content.
