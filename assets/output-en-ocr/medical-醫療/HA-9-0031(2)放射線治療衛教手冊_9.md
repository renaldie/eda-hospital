### 2. Care Guidelines for Radiation Dermatitis in Head and Neck Cancer Patients

## (1) Definitions

Radiation dermatitis: Skin damage and inflammatory reactions caused by radiation therapy.

## (2) Applicable Population

Patients with head and neck cancer undergoing radiation therapy.

## (3) Care Methods and Precautions

Head and neck cancer patients typically begin to experience skin reactions resembling sunburn about 2–3 weeks after starting radiation therapy. The skin in the irradiated area will gradually become red, more sensitive, drier, and more fragile. In severe cases, peeling, oozing, pain, or ulceration may occur. These are normal responses to radiation therapy and will gradually improve after treatment cessation, with the skin eventually returning to its normal state. During radiation therapy, skin care in the treatment area should follow the following guidelines:

1. After daily bathing with warm water, gently pat the skin dry with a soft towel using a pressing motion; avoid rubbing or vigorously wiping the skin.

2. Enhance skin moisturization in the treated area.

3. Do not use razor blades, shaving creams, or depilatory agents, as these may cause skin damage.

4. Avoid massaging, scratching, or rubbing the irradiated skin, and do not apply adhesive tapes—including pain patches—or use cold or hot compresses directly on the irradiated area.

5. Do not apply any lotions, creams, powders, or skincare products to the irradiated area except those prescribed by a doctor.

## Important Reminders:

During radiation therapy, if you experience pain or discomfort due to radiation dermatitis, please visit the radiation oncology department immediately for evaluation by a doctor. The doctor will prescribe appropriate medications or provide suitable treatments based on your symptoms.
