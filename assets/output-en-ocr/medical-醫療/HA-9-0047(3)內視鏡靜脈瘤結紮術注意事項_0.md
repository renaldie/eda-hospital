## Endoscopic Variceal Ligation Precautions

## I. Definitions

Varices are prone to rupture and cause massive bleeding due to excessive pressure within blood vessels. To treat or prevent rupture and bleeding, endoscopic variceal ligation can be performed using a gastroscope. A special rubber band is placed around the varix, which then shrinks due to the interruption of blood flow, achieving the therapeutic goal.

## II. Applicable Candidates

Patients with liver cirrhosis, hepatitis, alcoholics, and patients with portal hypertension.

## III. Care and Precautions

1. ☐ Need to fast for another 4 hours after examination (including water, medication, and smoking)

☐ Need to fast for another 1 hour after examination (including water, medication, and smoking)

☐ Need to continue fasting as instructed by the doctor after examination (including water, medication, and smoking)
