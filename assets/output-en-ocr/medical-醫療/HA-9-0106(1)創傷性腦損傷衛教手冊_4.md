## Three. Classification

## Possible Brain Injuries

## (1) Widespread Brain Injury

## One. Concussion

• Temporary impairment of physiological function, with normal brain CT scans showing no substantive or structural damage; it is a reversible neurological functional traumatic paralysis.

- Symptoms: memory loss after trauma, headache, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, unsteady gait, impaired memory, personality and emotional changes.

## Two. Widespread Neuroaxonal Injury

- Involves widespread rupture of brain axons, leading to failure of neural signal transmission and causing severe neurological dysfunction.

- Symptoms: deep coma, disruption of autonomic nervous functions (e.g., hyperthermia, hypertension, night sweats).
