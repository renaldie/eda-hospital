(2) Correct method of administering eye drops, as shown in the figure below:

Wash your hands with soap.

◆ Look up when applying the drops. Gently pull down the lower eyelid to create a small space between the lower eyelid and the conjunctiva, and place the drop into this space. Be careful not to touch the bottle tip.

### 2. Use of Eye Patch

(1) To prevent eye injury or accidental rubbing, wear the eye patch throughout the day or while sleeping.

(2) The eye patch should be disinfected once daily. Choose one of the following methods:

☑ Boil the eye patch in water for 15 minutes.

Wipe the eye patch with a 75% alcohol cotton swab. First disinfect the inside of the patch, then the outside.

(3) Place the narrower end of the patch downward, covering the operated eye. Tear two strips of paper tape and attach them to both sides of the patch, ensuring they do not block the central line of sight.

## 4. Precautions

1. Avoid rubbing your eyes or lifting heavy objects for one month. Always wear an eye patch when sleeping.

2. When washing your face or hair, be careful not to let water enter your eyes.

3. To protect your eyes, it is recommended to wear sunglasses without prescription or protective goggles when going out.

4. If you experience severe pain, increased discharge, or sudden blurring of vision, infection may have occurred—please visit the clinic immediately.

5. If you accidentally bump your eye and experience pain or vision loss, please visit the clinic as soon as possible.
