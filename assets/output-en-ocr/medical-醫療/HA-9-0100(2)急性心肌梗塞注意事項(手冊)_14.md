## IX. Home Care Guidelines and Lifestyle Modifications

Remove risk factors such as controlling high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, quitting smoking, and weight loss. Additionally, appropriate physical activity is the most cost-effective and effective method for preventing such cardiovascular diseases.

1. For the first week after discharge, avoid intense physical activities and excessive flexion of the hip or knee joints, such as climbing hills, rapidly going up or down stairs, or lifting heavy objects.

2. If, after discharge, you experience pain, swelling, persistent bleeding, or bruising at the wound site, return to the hospital immediately for follow-up.

3. Take medications regularly. The primary function of these medications is to prevent re-occlusion or spasm of blood vessels. If you experience any adverse effects from the medication, discuss it with your doctor and adjust the treatment accordingly—do not stop taking the medication on your own.

4. Attend regular follow-up appointments, as some patients may experience recurrence of chest pain, which could indicate re-occlusion of blood vessels. Such re-occlusion often occurs within six months after surgery.

5. If you experience any discomfort during this period—especially chest tightness, shortness of breath, or palpitations—inform your doctor during your follow-up visit. In case of severe symptoms, seek medical attention earlier than scheduled.
