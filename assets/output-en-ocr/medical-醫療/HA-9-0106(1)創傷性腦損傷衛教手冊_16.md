## Seven. Symptoms

"Intracranial pressure" (ICP) refers to the pressure within the cranial cavity. Severe head injuries often lead to increased intracranial pressure. When intracranial pressure rises, blood flow into the brain is restricted, and brain tissue will quickly suffer ischemia and die.

## Signs of Increased Intracranial Pressure

Headache, dizziness  
Nausea and vomiting  
Altered consciousness  
Restlessness and agitation  
Elevated blood pressure  
Decreased pulse  
Irregular breathing  
Dilated pupils  
Seizures

## Factors that May Trigger Increased Intracranial Pressure

• Increased intrathoracic and intra-abdominal pressure: such as forceful coughing or defecation  
- Changes in body position: higher intracranial pressure when lying flat; improper head positioning affecting cerebral blood flow circulation  
Environmental stimuli: overly bright light or noisy environments may trigger increased intracranial pressure
