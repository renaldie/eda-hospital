## Six. Treatment

The purpose of brain injury treatment is to prevent secondary brain injuries, which mostly arise from intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral ischemia, increased intracranial pressure, brain herniation, and brain infection. The treatment methods are as follows:

## (1) Surgical Treatment

Emergency evacuation of acute intracranial hematoma

Based on the principle of removing the hematoma and rapidly reducing intracranial pressure.

Cranial bone removal surgery

• Improves cerebral blood flow and effectively reduces intracranial pressure.

Intracranial pressure monitoring system placement and ventricular drainage surgery

- Establishes an intracranial pressure monitoring system and performs ventricular drainage as needed to reduce or maintain normal intracranial pressure.

## Preoperative Preparation (except for emergency surgery)

Shaving the head

Fasting for 8 hours before surgery

Practice deep breathing and coughing

Relax the mind and emotions
