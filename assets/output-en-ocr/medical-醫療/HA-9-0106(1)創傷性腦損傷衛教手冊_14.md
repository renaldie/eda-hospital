## Six. Treatment (Continued)

## (2) Non-surgical Treatment

- Closely monitor the patient's level of consciousness, vital signs, and observe for signs of increased intracranial pressure.

- Maintain a patent airway, ensure adequate oxygenation to prevent cerebral hypoxia, and consider intubation if necessary.

• Limit fluid and nutritional intake: fluid restriction helps reduce cerebral edema, while malnutrition can lead to persistent cerebral edema.

- Provide a safe and quiet environment, minimize stimuli, and administer analgesics, sedatives, and muscle relaxants as needed based on the patient's condition.

• Monitor body temperature and control it, as literature indicates that a 1°C rise in body temperature increases cerebral metabolic demand by 10–13%.

• Correct electrolyte and coagulation abnormalities.

• Prevent complications such as seizures and infections
