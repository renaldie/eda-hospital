## Ten. Rehabilitation Exercise Therapy (Continued)

Brain injury patients often experience difficulty with movements on one side of the body, which affects their ability to perform daily living activities, thereby impacting their self-confidence and self-esteem. By engaging in rehabilitation therapy together with family members and applying these skills in real-life situations, daily living participation can be improved, reducing dependence on others and restoring autonomy and confidence.

## ◆ Dressing Activities Training for Patients with Hemiplegia

## Basic Principles

(1) One must sit steadily to dress properly.  
(A sturdy and safe chair, with both feet placed on a stable surface)

(2) Wear the affected side first, then the unaffected side; remove the unaffected side first, then the affected side. (Mnemonic: "Put on the bad side, take off the good side")

(3) Start with larger-sized clothing; front-buttoned garments are easier to manage.

## Dressing Method for Front-Buttoned Garments

(1) Place the garment over both legs, with the inside facing outward and the collar near the body. Use the unaffected hand to put the affected arm into the sleeve and pull the sleeve up.

(2) Lean slightly forward, use the unaffected hand to pull the unaffected arm into the sleeve. The collar will go around the back and be brought to the unaffected side.

(3) Put the unaffected hand into the sleeve, raise the arm, and push the sleeve over the shoulder. Finally, adjust the garment and fasten the buttons.
