### 1. Brain Radiation Therapy Care Guidelines

## (1) Definitions

Brain radiation therapy uses high-energy X-rays to irradiate tumors, causing them to shrink, and is considered a localized treatment.

## (2) Applicable Population

When a brain tumor grows in a location or reaches a size that cannot be completely removed through surgery, and after evaluation by a physician, radiation therapy may be arranged post-surgery as an adjunctive treatment.

## (3) Common Side Effects and Causes

| Side Effect | Cause |
|-----------|-------|
| Headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting | Temporary increase in intracranial pressure during treatment. |
| Skin redness and itching | Skin inflammation reactions may occur in the scalp, ears, external auditory canal, and posterior neck area during treatment. |
| Hair loss | Hair follicles are damaged due to radiation exposure to the scalp within the treatment area. |
| Epilepsy | Patients with brain tumors are more prone to developing epilepsy. |

## (4) Care Methods and Precautions

Maintain regular sleep patterns and avoid staying up late. Diet should avoid stimulating foods such as coffee and strong tea, and opt for light meals to maintain a stable body weight.
