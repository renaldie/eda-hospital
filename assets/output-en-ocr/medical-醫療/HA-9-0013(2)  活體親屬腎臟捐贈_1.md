Kidney transplantation is the best method for treating end-stage renal failure and restoring health. Due to the shortage of organs and difficulties in recruitment, according to the Organ Transplantation Act, living kidney donation is limited to individuals who are blood relatives or spouses within the fifth degree of kinship and are adults aged 20 years or older. The advantages of relative donation include shorter waiting times for recipients, stable donor health allowing for thorough evaluations, and a higher success rate for kidney transplants between relatives. As a result, an increasing number of patients are undergoing relative kidney transplants, making living relative kidney donation a warm and hopeful path to recovery for those on the waiting list.

Potential living kidney donors must meet the following criteria:

(1) Healthy adults aged between 20 and 70 years.

(2) Normal function in both kidneys.

(3) Generally healthy with no chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, tuberculosis, no history of tumors, or any highly contagious diseases.

(4) Voluntary donation with pure and genuine motivation.

We conduct comprehensive physical, mental, psychological, and social evaluations of donors to ensure there are no potential health risks that could affect the donor's well-being.

## Surgical Procedure

Donors must first visit the transplant outpatient clinic for a physician consultation and medical evaluation. Following this, blood tests, tissue matching, and other relevant examinations will be conducted. If no special issues are found, the donor will proceed to psychological evaluation by a psychiatrist and social work assessment by a social worker. According to the Organ Transplantation Act, all evaluation data must be submitted to the Medical Ethics Committee of our hospital for review and approval before a living relative kidney transplant can proceed.

The surgery is performed via laparoscopic or open abdominal surgery. One kidney and its ureter are removed from the donor and transplanted into the recipient's lower abdomen. The donor surgery typically lasts about 4–5 hours. The transplant surgery date is determined by coordination between donor and recipient, based on their physical condition and personal needs. The success rate of the transplant varies depending on the donor source. For donations from healthy relatives, the one-year survival rate of the transplanted kidney exceeds 90%. For donations from brain-dead unrelated donors, the survival rate is approximately 80–90%. If no rejection occurs within six months, the recipient is generally expected to have excellent kidney function. The post-transplant outcomes for living donor and deceased donor kidney transplants are essentially the same.

## Risks and Complications of Kidney Transplant Surgery

This is a major surgical procedure, and like other surgeries, it carries potential risks such as surgical site infection, pneumonia, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism, bleeding, and allergic reactions to anesthetics. Most complications can be managed with medication, while only a few severe complications require invasive treatments.

## Post-Operative Health

Under normal circumstances, after donating one kidney, the remaining kidney can fully compensate for renal function, with no adverse effects on the body's physiological functions or on the donor's lifespan or daily life. On average, donors can be discharged from the hospital 5 to 7 days after surgery. After surgery, donors should avoid actions that increase abdominal pressure, such as lifting heavy objects or straining during bowel movements. By the fourth week post-surgery, they can return to light, non-strenuous work. After about two to three months, they can resume physically demanding work. After discharge, proper wound care and regular follow-up visits to the outpatient clinic are required.
