### 3. After catheterization:

(1) After returning to the ward, monitor blood pressure and heart rate every 15 minutes for 1 hour, then every 30 minutes for 3 hours.

(2) If the catheterization site is the wrist, medical staff will apply a tourniquet or gauze with a wide band around the puncture site. The band will be gradually removed over 4 hours, and completely removed the next morning. The wound will be re-dressed with waterproof adhesive film. Avoid using the affected limb, and do not lift heavy objects for one week after the procedure.

(3) If the catheterization site is in the groin, and the catheter has already been removed in the catheterization room, the medical staff will directly apply pressure for 30 minutes using a pressure device at the puncture site to stop bleeding. Then, a sandbag weighing approximately 2 kg will be placed for 4 hours of compression. The puncture site should not be bent and the sandbag should remain in place. After removing the sandbag, the patient should lie flat for 4–6 hours without turning over to prevent bleeding. After the sandbag is removed, the patient may sit semi-upright, but should monitor the wound for any signs of bleeding.

(4) For femoral artery catheterization in the groin with the catheter still in place, the patient must lie flat before catheter removal. After catheter removal, continue with 4 hours of sandbag compression and remain flat for another 6 hours. The buttocks may be moved left and right, but the affected limb joints must remain straight and not bent to avoid forceful movements. The ankle may be freely moved, and the limb will remain fixed for the duration of the evaluation of vital signs and blood circulation and temperature of both upper and lower limbs.

(5) After returning to the ward, lie completely flat for 4 hours. If urination is needed, use a commode or urinal. If no urination occurs after 6 hours, inform the nursing staff. If the wound is in the groin area and there is difficulty with bowel movements, inform the medical staff immediately to prevent bleeding from the wound.

(6) If any of the following symptoms occur—nausea, vomiting, palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, coldness, pallor, numbness, tingling, pain, or abnormal swelling, bruising, or wet and hot dressing at the wound site—inform the medical staff immediately.
