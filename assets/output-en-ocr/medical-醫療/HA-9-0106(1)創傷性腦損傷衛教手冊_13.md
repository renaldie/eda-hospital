## Six. Treatment (Continued)

## Postoperative Precautions

- Begin eating only as instructed by the doctor. Before eating, drink a small amount of water to confirm there is no vomiting.

- Turn the patient every two hours and assist with chest percussion to help expel sputum and prevent skin pressure injuries leading to pressure sores.

- Avoid forceful coughing or defecation. Take soft stool medications as prescribed by the doctor to reduce increased intracranial pressure and cerebral edema.

- Do not touch the wound or the dressing with your hands to prevent infection.

- Pay attention to the wound drainage tube and avoid pulling on it.

- Patients must wait until their condition stabilizes and receive permission from the doctor before getting up from bed. They must be assisted by someone to get up, to prevent falls.

- For patients who have undergone cranial bone removal, avoid pressing on the affected side. Typically, after evaluation by the doctor and stabilization of the condition within three months, the cranial bone will be repositioned.
