## ☑ Wound Care Precautions

1. The puncture site of the dialysis catheter should be kept clean at all times to prevent infection.

2. After performing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), compression hemostasis will continue for 2 hours, and it is recommended that patients remain at the hospital during this time for observation. Patients may only leave once the hemostasis condition of the catheter has improved.

3. After dialysis, the dialysis catheter should be properly managed to achieve hemostasis. It is advisable to avoid prolonged compression using a pressure bandage.

4. It is recommended to rotate the puncture site during dialysis sessions to extend the lifespan of the catheter.

5. Avoid puncturing at areas with vascular malformations, hard lumps, or bruises.

6. Follow medical instructions and actively perform fist clenching exercises to expand the dialysis catheter in the arm.

7. Avoid sleeping on the side to prevent long-term compression of the catheter.

## ● Seek medical attention or contact the dialysis unit immediately if any of the following situations occur:

1. Abnormal elevation of venous pressure during dialysis, which may indicate catheter narrowing.

2. Swelling in the arm with the dialysis catheter—this may suggest central venous obstruction or stenosis.

3. Redness or discharge from the arm with the dialysis catheter—this may indicate infection.

4. Coldness, numbness, or pain in the hand.

5. Skin wounds with bleeding risk.

6. Formation of a large or abnormally enlarged vascular malformation.

7. Inability to feel pulsation or hear sounds in the dialysis catheter—this may suggest catheter obstruction.

8. Abnormal sounds from the dialysis catheter—this may indicate an imminent risk of catheter obstruction.
