## Comprehensive Lung Recovery Program

Lung recovery is a comprehensive intervention strategy individually tailored based on detailed patient assessments, including exercise training, health education (such as disease education, medication education, etc.), and promotion of healthy behaviors. The aim is to improve the physiological and psychological conditions of patients with obstructive lung disease and to enhance their long-term adherence to beneficial health behaviors.

## Five. Non-pharmacological Treatment for Obstructive Lung Disease

## Exercise Training

Improve muscle strength and cardio-pulmonary function, reduce breathlessness during physical activity, and improve daily activities and quality of life.

## Pursed-Lip Breathing & Diaphragmatic Breathing

Through breathing exercises, the exhalation time can be increased to reduce lung gas retention, helping to decrease dynamic overinflation caused by exercise and thereby improving the patient's breathlessness.
