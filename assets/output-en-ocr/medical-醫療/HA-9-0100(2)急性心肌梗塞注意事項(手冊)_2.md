## One. What is acute myocardial infarction?

When the blood vessels supplying the heart become narrowed or blocked, the heart muscle cannot receive sufficient oxygen and nutrients. This leads to myocardial necrosis and hypoxia, affecting heart function and cardiac cells. In severe cases, it can endanger a patient's life. Therefore, when a myocardial infarction occurs, it is essential to act as quickly as possible to restore blood flow and minimize the damage caused by myocardial hypoxia.

## Two. Common symptoms of myocardial infarction:

1. A pressing, constricting pain in the lower part of the sternum, with a heavy, burning, or otherwise indescribable discomfort. If the pain persists, it may last for 30 minutes or longer and is typically not relieved by rest or nitroglycerin (NTG). There is no specific time of occurrence; in severe cases, patients may experience shortness of breath, loss of consciousness, arrhythmias, hypotension, or even shock.

2. The pain may radiate to the arms, shoulders, neck, jaw, or back, often accompanied by weakness, sweating, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, digestive discomfort, and abdominal bloating.

3. Fever may appear 24–48 hours after the onset of myocardial infarction.

## Three. Risk factors:

### 1. Age:

As age increases, the incidence of ischemic heart disease also increases.

### 2. Gender:

Men—The incidence of ischemic heart disease increases rapidly after age 45.

Women—The incidence gradually increases after age 55 or after menopause.

### 3. Family history:

If either parent has had a myocardial infarction, the child's risk of developing myocardial infarction increases.

### 4. High cholesterol:

The more cholesterol present in the blood, the thicker the deposits on the vessel walls become, leading to plaque formation, arterial hardening, narrowing of the vessel lumen, and increased risk of vessel occlusion. The incidence of ischemic heart disease is directly proportional to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) concentration and inversely proportional to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) concentration.
