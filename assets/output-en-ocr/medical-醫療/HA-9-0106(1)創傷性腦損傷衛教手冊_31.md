## Eleven. Precautions for Home Care

• After discharge, patients may still experience symptoms such as headache, difficulty concentrating, dizziness, tinnitus, and general weakness, which may persist for several months. It is recommended to regularly follow up with outpatient visits.

- Post-traumatic epilepsy is a common complication and attention should be paid to any signs of limb convulsions.

- If the condition has not improved significantly or if the patient is unable to fully concentrate, driving or operating machinery should be avoided.

- For patients with unsteady gait or limb weakness, comprehensive exercises including balance training, resistance exercises, walking, and weight shifting are recommended after discharge. Additionally, improving the safety of the home environment can help reduce the risk of falls.
