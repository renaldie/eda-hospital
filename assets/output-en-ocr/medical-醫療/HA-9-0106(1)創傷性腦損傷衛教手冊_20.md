## Eight. Medication Guidance for Anti-Epileptic Drugs (Continued)

2. Valproic Acid (Valproate)

☑ Clinical Uses: Control epilepsy or seizures

☑ Possible Side Effects and Contraindications

(1) It may cause drowsiness; therefore, patients are advised not to operate vehicles or machinery or perform other tasks requiring high alertness while taking this medication.

(2) It may pose a risk during pregnancy or in women planning to become pregnant, as the drug has teratogenic properties. Patients should inform their physician and discuss alternative medications.

(3) Valproate is metabolized by the liver. Patients with liver disease, or those taking other antiepileptic drugs or antibiotics, should inform their physician beforehand to avoid changes in drug concentration—either too high or too low—which could affect seizure control.

(4) This medication may prolong bleeding time. Patients should inform their physician before surgery (including dental procedures) that they are taking this drug, so that blood tests can be evaluated if necessary.
