## Seizure Management

## ✓ Prevent injury to the patient:

(1) Stay calm and remain by the patient's side to protect them from accidental injuries.

(2) Remove nearby sharp objects; if soft cushions or clothing are available, place them under the patient's head. When moving the patient, avoid pulling their arms—instead, push the body gently to prevent shoulder dislocation.

(3) If food or dentures are present in the mouth at the onset of the seizure, remove them. However, if the seizure has lasted for some time, do not forcibly open the mouth.

✓ Do not press on the patient: Do not move or forcibly restrain the patient's limbs, as this may cause muscle strains, fractures, or dislocations. Do not squeeze, slap, or shake the patient, as the patient will naturally regain consciousness after the convulsions subside.

✓ Stay with the patient: Do not leave the patient to seek help. The patient will feel much more reassured knowing someone is present during recovery.
