## Introduction to Living Liver Donation Surgery

The first living liver donation surgery dates back nearly thirty years. According to the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the one-year survival rate after liver transplantation is 93%, and the five-year survival rate is 75%. Liver transplantation is a first-line treatment option for patients with irreversible liver damage. However, due to a severe shortage of liver donor sources, living liver donation provides an alternative option for patients.
