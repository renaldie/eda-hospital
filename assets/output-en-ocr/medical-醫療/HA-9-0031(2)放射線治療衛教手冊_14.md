### 6. Radiation Therapy Care Guidelines for Colorectal Cancer

## (1) Definitions

### a. Colorectal Cancer

The lowest part of the digestive system is called the colon. The final 6 inches of the colon is known as the rectum. After food digestion, waste passes through the colon and rectum (commonly referred to as the large intestine) and is expelled from the body. Cancer that develops in this area is called colorectal cancer (also known as colon or rectal cancer).

### b. Radiation Therapy

Patients with colorectal cancer undergoing concurrent radiation therapy will receive approximately one session per day, five times per week, for a total of about five weeks. The purpose is to prevent local recurrence and possible metastasis; or to shrink the tumor size, allowing for subsequent surgical removal.
