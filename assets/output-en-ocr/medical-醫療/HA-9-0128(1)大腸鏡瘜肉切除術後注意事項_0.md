# Post-Endoscopic Polypectomy Care Instructions

## 1. Definitions

Polyps are abnormal hyperplasia of the gastrointestinal mucosal tissue. Most are asymptomatic, but some may progress to cancerous changes. For such polyps, if their size is suitable, endoscopic removal can be performed, and metal clips can be used to remove and send for pathological examination, thereby reducing the risk of future cancerization.

## 2. Applicable Population

Patients undergoing polyp removal via colonoscopy.

## 3. Precautions

1. After the procedure, mild abdominal distension is normal. You may walk more, or apply peppermint oil or green oil to help expel air and relieve bloating.

☐ Low-residue soft diet:

For the next three days, please consume low-residue soft foods such as porridge, noodles, steamed egg, and well-cooked fish and meat. Avoid hard foods (such as peanuts, beans, nuts) and high-fiber vegetables and fruits, to prevent inflammation at the surgical site after polyp removal.

(2) Patients taking anticoagulant dietary supplements such as fish oil, natto, or red rice wine should discontinue use for ___ days.

☐ Activity:
