## Reference, Q & A

Q1: Doctor, I am 45 years old. I had a bone density test, and the result said my bones are like those of a 70-year-old. Does this mean I have osteoporosis?

A1: This statement is not accurate. Even if a 45-year-old woman has bone density similar to that of a 70-year-old, her physical activity and muscle strength are better than those of a 70-year-old, so her risk of fracture is still much lower than that of a 70-year-old. Therefore, there is no need to be overly concerned. Early prevention and intervention are sufficient.

Q2: I am 48 years old. I went to the hospital for a bone density test using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and my T-value is less than -2.5. Does this mean I have osteoporosis?

A2: For men under the age of 50, unless there are other risk factors for fractures or secondary causes of low bone density (such as taking steroids for more than three months, hypogonadism, or hyperparathyroidism), clinicians should be more conservative in interpreting the results. A diagnosis of osteoporosis should not be made solely based on bone density test results.

## Part I: The Health Hazards of Smoking

Tobacco contains over 7,000 chemicals, including more than 90 known carcinogens. Smoking is responsible for 30% of all cancer deaths. The primary carcinogens in tobacco come from tar, which can directly lead to cancers such as lung cancer, oral cancer, pharyngeal cancer, bladder cancer, esophageal cancer, and many other health issues, including respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, gingival recession, tooth loss, infertility, erectile dysfunction, memory decline, osteoporosis, duodenal ulcers, gastric ulcers, and respiratory problems in infants and young children.

## Part II: What Is "Thirdhand Smoke"?

Thirdhand smoke refers to pollutants left behind in the environment (such as curtains, sofas, and clothes) after tobacco combustion. These pollutants include hydrogen cyanide (used in chemical weapons), butane (in lighters), toluene (in paint thinners), arsenic, lead, carbon monoxide, and even highly radioactive carcinogens like polonium-210. There are 11 highly carcinogenic compounds in thirdhand smoke.

## Part III: Is It Harmful to Be in a Room Where Someone Has Smoked?

Yes, thirdhand smoke is also harmful to health.
