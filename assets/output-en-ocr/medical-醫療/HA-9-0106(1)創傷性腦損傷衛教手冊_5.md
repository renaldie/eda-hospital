## (二) Local brain injury

## One. Brain contusion

• There is substantive damage to brain tissue near the impact site, with multiple punctate hemorrhages and cerebral edema appearing at the impacted area, which gradually absorb over time.

- Symptoms: In addition to the symptoms of concussion, symptoms such as drowsiness, unconsciousness, seizures, limb weakness, behavioral or personality changes, and rapid breathing may occur depending on the severity of the brain contusion.

## Two. Epidural hematoma

- Blood accumulates between the skull and the dura mater, often resulting from fracture of the skull causing vascular rupture and separation of the dura mater, thereby compressing brain tissue.

- Symptoms: About one-third of patients have no symptoms or mild symptoms; some may exhibit changes in consciousness within hours after injury.
