# Intermittent Self-Catheterization

## 1. What is Intermittent Self-Catheterization?

Patients perform self-catheterization every 3–4 hours or after using the toilet to drain the remaining urine from the bladder.

## 2. Purpose of Intermittent Self-Catheterization:

1. To drain the urine from the bladder at regular intervals and prevent bladder overdistension.

2. To measure the amount of urine remaining in the bladder after each voiding.

3. To remove residual urine and prevent accumulation, which could lead to infection.

## 3. Preparation Items:

☐ 12 or 14 gauge catheter (☐ Male ☐ Female)  
☐ Povidone-iodine solution approximately 200 mL per bottle  
☐ Lubricant  
☐ Soap  

☐ Measuring cup (or container suitable for collecting urine)  
☐ Standing mirror with rotating function (as shown in Figure 1)

| Parameter               | Value       |
|------------------------|-------------|
| Sample Size            | 22 cm       |
| Sample Thickness       | 23 cm       |
| Sample Thickness at 21.5 cm | 9 cm       |

## 4. Step-by-step Procedure for Intermittent Self-Catheterization:

1. Clean the penis and urethral opening in males, or the external genitalia and urethral opening in females using neutral soap and water.

2. If performed with assistance, the male patient should lie supine (flat on back), while the female patient should lie supine with knees bent; for self-catheterization, a semi-sitting position is recommended.

3. The caregiver should wash hands with soap or hand sanitizer.

4. Remove the catheter from its storage tube, apply lubricant, and prepare the measuring cup.

5. Insert the catheter into the urethral opening (females can use a mirror to locate the correct position; insertion depth for males is approximately 20–25 cm, and for females approximately 5–10 cm).

6. Allow urine to flow into the container, gently pressing on the pubic area to empty the bladder completely before removing the catheter.

7. Rinse the catheter with clean water, dry it thoroughly, and store it in a disinfectant solution with the cap securely tightened.

## 5. Precautions:

1. Self-catheter disinfection method: The catheter has a dedicated outer tube for water-soluble povidone-iodine. It should be replaced weekly to maintain antibacterial effectiveness.

2. Frequency of catheterization: Perform catheterization after using the toilet, about 3–4 times during the day, once before bedtime and once upon waking. The frequency can be adjusted based on urine volume or as directed by a physician.

3. Monitor changes in urine characteristics. If urine becomes red, cloudy, or has an altered odor, consult a healthcare professional.

4. Self-catheters can be reused; however, if the smooth surface is damaged or the catheter tip becomes blocked, it should be replaced immediately.
