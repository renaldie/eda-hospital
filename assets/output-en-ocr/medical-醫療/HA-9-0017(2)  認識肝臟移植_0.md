## V. Preoperative Assessment

Liver transplantation is a high-risk and lengthy surgical procedure, therefore a comprehensive preoperative evaluation is required to assess the patient's tolerance to prolonged surgery, to identify any underlying diseases, and to anticipate potential postoperative complications. The following are the preoperative assessment items:

(1) Blood tests, including blood type, liver and kidney function, tumor markers, arterial blood gas analysis, hepatitis B or C virus load, and testing for opportunistic infections, etc.

(2) Urine tests (including 24-hour urine collection) and stool tests.

(3) Cardiopulmonary function assessment, including electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography, cardiac blood flow scan, chest X-ray, and pulmonary function tests.

(4) Imaging studies, including abdominal ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bone density, and breast ultrasound (for women).

(5) Endoscopic examinations, including gastroscopy and colonoscopy.

(6) Multidisciplinary consultations, including cardiology, pulmonology, anesthesiology, psychiatry, and dentistry.

(7) For patients with liver tumors, additional bone scan is required. For patients with Wilson's disease, blood and urine copper level tests are needed.

(8) Other tests are determined based on individual patient conditions, such as positron emission tomography (PET) scan.

Once the preoperative assessment is completed and the patient's condition is stable, they can return home and await follow-up visits at the outpatient clinic.

## VI. Surgical Procedure for Liver Transplantation

Liver sources can be divided into deceased donors (including brain death or cardiac death) or living donors. For deceased donors, upon receiving notification from the transplant team, patients should follow instructions to fast and proceed to the emergency department for hospitalization. For living donors, surgical scheduling requires approval from the Medical Ethics Committee. The liver surgery typically lasts 8–12 hours. After surgery, patients are transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for approximately 3–5 days of care. Once stable, they are transferred to the transplant ward (single-room, isolated care). The total hospital stay is approximately 14–21 days.

## VII. Postoperative Home Care and Regular Outpatient Follow-up

Postoperative home care and patient and family education begin immediately after transplantation. This includes understanding the phenomenon of rejection, familiarizing oneself with medications, diet, infection prevention, and home care, etc.

Since the transplanted liver is not the patient's own organ, lifelong immunosuppressive medication is required. However, these immunosuppressive drugs also suppress the patient's immune system. Therefore, regular outpatient follow-up is extremely important.
