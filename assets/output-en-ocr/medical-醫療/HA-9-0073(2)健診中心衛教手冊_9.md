## Hypertension

## ★ What is hypertension?

Blood pressure refers to the pressure exerted on the walls of blood vessels when blood is pumped from the heart and flows through the vessels. Blood pressure can be expressed in two ways:

## Section One: Systolic pressure (commonly known as high blood pressure):

The pressure formed when the heart contracts and blood is ejected from the ventricles, impacting the arterial walls (normal: <120 mmHg).

## Section Two: Diastolic pressure (commonly known as low blood pressure):

The pressure formed when the heart relaxes and blood flows through the arterial system (normal: <80 mmHg).

## Section Three: How to determine "hypertension"?

Measure blood pressure in a calm state, with at least three readings over two consecutive weeks, all exceeding 140/90 mmHg.

## Section Four: What are the symptoms of hypertension?

In the early stages, there are often no noticeable symptoms. Most patients are unaware they have hypertension, which is why hypertension is known as the "silent killer." Symptoms mainly depend on the extent of organ damage:

1. **Cerebrovascular obstruction**: Symptoms include headache, dizziness, head pressure, memory loss, difficulty concentrating, and insomnia. In severe cases, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke may occur, leading to various complications.

2. **Cardiac issues**: Palpitations, heart failure (difficulty breathing, lower limb edema), coronary artery hardening (chest tightness, angina).

3. **Renal insufficiency**: Proteinuria, oliguria, lower limb edema.

4. **Retinal vascular changes**: Vision loss, retinal bleeding.

5. **Peripheral vascular hardening**: Intermittent claudication, numbness in the limbs (due to arterial hardening causing reduced or interrupted blood flow to the lower limbs).
