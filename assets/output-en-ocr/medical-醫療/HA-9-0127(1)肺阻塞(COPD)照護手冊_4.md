## Two. Overview of Diagnosis and Treatment of Pulmonary Obstruction

Family history

## Physician Evaluation

## Has the patient smoked? Long-term smoking?

Does the patient frequently cough? Does the patient often produce sputum?

Does the patient experience sudden shortness of breath that is getting worse over time?

Is the patient particularly short of breath during physical activity (e.g., exercise, climbing stairs, lifting heavy objects)?

Does the patient have persistent shortness of breath?

Has the patient been exposed to kitchen oil fumes for a long time?

Has the patient been exposed to occupational dust (e.g., asbestos, silica, coal dust, cotton, grains) or chemicals (sulfuric acid, nitric acid, ammonia)?

Does a family member or relative have a history of pulmonary obstruction?

## Pulmonary Function Test

An essential diagnostic examination in thoracic medicine

A method to assess lung function by measuring lung volumes

During the test, the patient takes a deep breath and then forcefully exhales

The degree of airflow obstruction is evaluated using Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1)

If FEV1/FVC < 70%, it indicates airflow obstruction

Diagnosis of pulmonary obstruction is confirmed by combining physician assessment with symptom severity, smoking history, exposure to risk factors, chest X-ray, etc.
