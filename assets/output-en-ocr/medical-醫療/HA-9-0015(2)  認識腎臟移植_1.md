## 1. What is kidney transplantation?

Kidney transplantation involves surgically implanting a functional kidney—typically donated by family members of brain-dead donors, healthy relatives within the five-degree blood relationship, or spouses—into a recipient to replace a non-functional kidney and restore essential metabolic functions.

## 2. Who is eligible for kidney transplantation?

Most patients with end-stage renal failure (uremia) who rely on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis to sustain life are generally suitable candidates for kidney transplantation, unless they have other contraindications, such as malignant tumors, systemic infections, severe cardiovascular diseases, coagulation disorders, chronic respiratory failure, heart failure, psychiatric disorders, severe congenital urinary system abnormalities, or AIDS. Final eligibility must be determined by evaluation by both nephrologists and urologists.

## 3. What is the success rate of kidney transplantation? What are the risks and complications?

The success rate varies depending on the donor source: for donations from healthy relatives, the one-year survival rate of the transplanted kidney exceeds 98%; for donations from unrelated brain-dead donors, the success rate is approximately 80–90%. The risks and complications of kidney transplantation are similar to those of other surgical procedures. Most complications can be managed with medication, while only a few severe complications require invasive treatments.

## 4. Can relatives donate a kidney for transplantation?

Waiting for a kidney is rare and unpredictable. According to the Organ Transplantation Act, living kidney donations are limited to spouses or blood relatives within the five-degree relationship. The advantages of relative donation include shorter waiting times for recipients and more stable donor health, with sufficient time for thorough medical screening. Because of the higher success rates associated with relative donations, an increasing number of patients are now undergoing kidney transplants from relatives. The conditions required for a living kidney donor are as follows:

1. The donor must be a healthy adult aged between 20 and 70 years.

2. Both kidneys must have normal function.

3. The donor must not have chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, or tuberculosis; must have no history of tumors, or be free from highly contagious diseases (e.g., AIDS).

4. The donor must voluntarily donate the kidney with pure and sincere intentions.

## 5. What impact does donating a kidney have on health? What checks are required before donation?

Under normal circumstances, after donating one kidney, the remaining kidney can fully compensate for the lost function, with no adverse effects on overall physiological health. Before donation, the following checks are required:

1. Blood type and tissue matching tests, including mixed lymphocyte culture cross-matching.

2. Liver and kidney function tests, urine analysis, and urine culture.

3. Electrocardiogram (ECG), chest X-ray, and pelvic ultrasound.

4. Consultation with a psychiatrist and social worker for psychological and social evaluation.

## 6. Is living kidney transplantation covered by health insurance? How much does it cost? When can donors be discharged from hospital? When can they return to normal life?

Currently, the preoperative evaluation and surgery for living kidney transplantation are fully covered by the National Health Insurance (NHI), and patients do not have to pay out-of-pocket expenses. Only minor additional costs (such as extra hospital room fees or meals) are required. On average, donors can be discharged from the hospital 5 to 7 days after surgery. If no complications occur, proper wound care and regular follow-up visits after discharge will not interfere with daily life.

## 7. Post-transplant care

Kidney transplantation involves removing the donor’s kidney and implanting it into the recipient’s lower abdomen, either on the left or right side. The blood vessels of the new kidney are connected to the recipient’s blood vessels, and the ureter is connected to the recipient’s bladder. The original kidney is not removed. The surgery typically takes 4 to 5 hours, with a hospital stay of about two weeks. During hospitalization, transplant surgeons, specialist nurses, and ward nurses will assist the recipient in adapting to postoperative changes, educate about symptoms of rejection and infection, and help the patient learn self-monitoring and home self-care. Organ transplant coordinators, clinical pharmacists, and nutritionists will also visit to assist the patient in understanding immunosuppressive medications.
