## Understanding Herniated Disc

## I. Location of the Intervertebral Disc:

The intervertebral disc is located between every two vertebrae. It is composed of cartilage, with a soft nucleus pulposus in the center and a strong, resilient annulus fibrosus surrounding it. The intervertebral disc functions to absorb and buffer pressure.

## II. What is a Herniated Disc?

When the intervertebral disc is subjected to sudden force or prolonged pressure, the surrounding ligaments may become damaged or weakened, causing the nucleus pulposus to protrude through the ligament and compress or push against spinal nerves. This condition is known as a herniated disc.

## III. Causes:

1. Age: Before the age of 30, herniated discs are often caused by sports injuries or carrying heavy loads. After the age of 40, the elasticity of the disc decreases and its function deteriorates.

2. Trauma: Falls or collisions.

3. Obesity: Excess body weight increases pressure on the lumbar spine.

4. Poor posture.

5. Lifting heavy objects.

## IV. Symptoms:

1. Lower back pain that may radiate to the back of the thigh.

2. Sciatica or cervical radiculopathy.

3. Spasms of the muscles in the upper and lower limbs, which worsen during activities such as coughing, defecation, bending, or lifting.

4. Diminished deep tendon reflexes.

5. Sensory numbness or tingling in the body regions under the nerve distribution of the affected area.

## V. Treatment:

1. Conservative therapy:

(a) Absolute bed rest for two to three weeks until pain subsides.

(b) Medication treatment.

(c) Physical therapy.

2. Surgical treatment:

(a) Microdiscectomy: Removal of the herniated disc fragment under a microscope.

(b) Lamectomy: Partial removal of the lamina via surgery to remove the ruptured nucleus pulposus and relieve pressure on the spinal cord.

(c) Spinal fusion: Bone grafts are taken from a bone bank or from the patient's iliac crest and placed into the intervertebral space during surgery to fuse two vertebrae together, achieving stabilization.

## VI. Postoperative Precautions:

1. The duration of bed rest after surgery varies depending on the procedure. Generally, it is: 1 day after microdiscectomy, 2 days after laminectomy, and 3 days after spinal fusion.

2. During bed rest, assistance from others should be used to turn over using a round roll and to perform daily activities to reduce the need for back muscle exertion.

3. After the catheter is removed, patients should get up and move around as soon as possible, unless otherwise instructed.

4. Some patients may need to wear a back brace as prescribed by the doctor before getting up and leaving the bed.

5. Except for bed rest, patients should wear a back brace at all times to maintain proper posture. For three months, avoid lifting heavy objects or riding a bicycle. For one year, avoid excessive strain on the neck, waist, or back.

## VII. Daily Life Recommendations:

1. Continue wearing the back brace for 2–3 months and wear it correctly.

2. Keep the bedsheet flat and sleep on a firmer mattress or a firm spring mattress.

3. Maintain proper posture when getting on and off the bed.

4. When picking up objects from the ground, bend down instead of bending forward.

5. Attend regular outpatient follow-up appointments as instructed by the doctor.

6. Return to the hospital immediately if any of the following occur:

(a) Signs of infection at the wound, such as redness, swelling, heat, or pain.

(b) A new back injury or impact.

(c) Recurrence of pre-surgical symptoms.
