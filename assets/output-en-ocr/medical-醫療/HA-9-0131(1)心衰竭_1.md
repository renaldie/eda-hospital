## What is heart failure?

Heart failure refers to the heart's inability to effectively pump blood to the entire body to meet the body's metabolic demands. This is typically caused by abnormalities in ventricular function, leading to cardiac remodeling (changes in myocardial structure and function), such as due to myocardial infarction, excessive pressure, fluid overload, infection, or toxic injury. These changes may result in myocardial hypoxia and necrosis, eventually leading to ventricular hypertrophy, reduced cardiac contractility, and ultimately heart failure.

Heart failure can be classified into four stages according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) criteria based on the patient's activity level and symptom severity:

· Class I: No limitation of ordinary activities; no discomfort during usual activities.

· Class II: Slight limitation of ordinary activities; symptoms such as fatigue or shortness of breath may occur during intense exercise.

· Class III: Marked limitation of physical activity; symptoms relieve at rest, but mild activity causes discomfort.

· Class IV: Symptoms occur regardless of activity; discomfort is present even at rest.

## Main symptoms:

· Shortness of breath: Due to increased fluid volume in the lungs, reducing air volume. This leads to shortness of breath during physical activity or work.

· Orthopnea: In severe heart failure, patients experience shortness of breath when lying flat; they must sit up or elevate their head to relieve symptoms.

· Coughing: Caused by large amounts of fluid accumulating in the lungs, stimulating the lung mucosa. This may present as dry cough or productive cough with frothy sputum and blood streaks.

· Fatigue: Often occurs after physical activity due to poor oxygenation of tissues.

· Peripheral edema, reduced urine output: Occurs in the limbs, liver enlargement, ascites, pulmonary edema, and pleural effusion.

· Rapid weight gain.

· Abdominal bloating, digestive discomfort.

· Loss of appetite, nausea, fatigue, right upper abdominal discomfort.

## Treatment of heart failure

Medication plays a key role in alleviating symptoms and reducing the heart's workload. Common medications include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), neprilysin inhibitors combined with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARNI), beta-blockers, diuretics (MRA), beta-blockers, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). Depending on the specific condition, patients may also take glucose-lowering or cholesterol-lowering drugs to reduce other risk factors that damage the heart.

## Daily care for heart failure

## (I) Daily activity planning

1. Daytime rest helps prevent overexertion and relieves fatigue caused by interrupted sleep; activities should be arranged according to the patient's condition, maintaining a regular lifestyle.

2. Moderate exercise, such as walking or climbing stairs, should be gradually increased to train heart function and improve overall physical condition, preventing disease progression and enhancing quality of life.

3. Avoid heavy physical labor and reduce working hours.

4. Maintain a comfortable and quiet environment, reduce anxiety, and maintain a positive mood. Avoid excitement, tension, or anger, as these may increase cardiac burden.

## (II) Dietary considerations

1. Eat small, frequent meals consisting of soft, easily digestible, and nutritionally balanced foods.

2. Follow a low-sodium diet, limiting daily added salt to no more than 5 grams. Avoid monosodium glutamate (MSG), soy sauce, and other high-sodium seasonings, as well as processed and preserved foods.

3. Maintain a balanced diet emphasizing fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, skinless poultry and fish, nuts and legumes, and non-tropical plant oils. Additionally, limit saturated fats.
