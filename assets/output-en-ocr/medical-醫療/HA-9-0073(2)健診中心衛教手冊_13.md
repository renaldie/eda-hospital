## Recognizing Hemorrhoids and Important Precautions

## I. Definition:

Pathological changes in the venous plexus at the terminal part of the rectum and around the anus, resulting in blood clots, are known as hemorrhoids. They can be classified into internal hemorrhoids, external hemorrhoids, and mixed hemorrhoids.

## II. Causes:

1. Prolonged excessive pressure on the anus during defecation, such as constipation.  
2. Poor venous return from the anus, such as during pregnancy, liver cirrhosis, or heart failure.  
3. Congenital absence of valves in the hemorrhoidal venous plexus.

## III. Symptoms:

1. Pain at the anus: swelling in the external hemorrhoid or pain caused by thrombosis.  
2. Bleeding: due to congestion of blood vessels within the hemorrhoidal tissue, and repeated prolapse leading to mucosal rupture and bleeding.  
3. Itching at the anus: dysfunction of the "anal cushion tissue" causing leakage of liquid feces, which irritates the skin and leads to itching.  

4. Prolapse: due to destruction of supporting tissues, causing the hemorrhoidal tissue to protrude outside the anus.

## IV. Diagnosis:

1. External hemorrhoids can be diagnosed through visual inspection.  
2. Internal hemorrhoids require diagnosis based on medical history, digital examination, and observation using an anoscope.

## V. Medical Treatment:

1. Medication therapy.  
2. Dietary therapy.  
3. Pain management.

## VI. Surgical Treatment:

1. Surgical excision: removal of the hemorrhoid, requiring anesthesia, with a high success rate.  
2. Rubber band ligation: the doctor inserts an anoscope and applies a rubber band to ligate the hemorrhoid. After 8–10 days, the hemorrhoidal tissue dies and falls off. This method does not require hospitalization and has gradually become the primary treatment for internal hemorrhoids.

## VII. Postoperative Precautions:

1. After surgery, due to anesthesia, pain, surgical site, or the use of anal dressings, some patients may experience difficulty in urination. Try listening to the sound of running water or take a warm sitz bath to stimulate urination. If necessary, nursing staff will perform single-time catheterization or indwelling catheterization.  
2. If there is no dizziness or discomfort, encourage the patient to get out of bed and move around.  
3. Maintain smooth bowel movements, establish regular defecation habits, and maintain good bowel health.  
4. Warm water cleansing or sitz bath:  

   (a) Purpose: Clean the surgical site, improve local blood circulation, and promote wound healing.  

   (b) Method:  
   1. Start time: the day after surgery  
   2. Water temperature: approximately 40.5–43.3°C (slightly warmer than body temperature is sufficient).  
   3. Frequency: 3–4 times per day and after each bowel movement.  
   4. Cleansing: use a clean washcloth each time.  
   5. Sitz bath: use a sitz bath basin, soaking for 5–10 minutes each time.  
   6. Local care after cleansing or sitz bath: dry the area, and apply ointment to the wound if needed, then cover with gauze (or cotton ball).  
   7. If dizziness, cold sweat, or palpitations occur during sitz bathing, it may be due to poor air conditioning or positional hypotension. Stop the sitz bath immediately, rest, and the symptoms should improve. Avoid excessively hot water or gradually extending the duration of sitz baths to reduce the occurrence of such discomfort.

## VIII. Daily Care:

1. Develop good bowel habits and avoid prolonged sitting on the toilet.  
2. Avoid constipation or diarrhea.  
3. Eat more high-fiber foods such as vegetables and fruits daily, and avoid alcohol, fried foods, and spicy foods.  
4. Maintain a regular lifestyle, engage in appropriate physical activity and rest, and avoid staying up late.  
5. Avoid maintaining the same posture for long periods while sitting or standing. For those who sit for long hours, it is recommended to move around for 3–4 minutes every hour.  
6. Avoid self-purchasing and using enemas or laxatives, as these may lead to habitual urinary retention.  
7. If any abnormal symptoms occur—such as blood in the stool or a lump at the anus—seek immediate consultation with a colorectal surgeon. Do not believe in unproven remedies or advertisements, as this may lead to worsening of the condition.
