2. Wear appropriate, light, comfortable clothing: sports attire, sports shoes, and a towel.

3. After rehabilitation exercises, appropriately replenish fluids. In response to environmental protection, please bring your own reusable water bottle.

4. Please avoid wearing nail polish or heavy makeup, as this may affect the assessment of vital signs and instrument monitoring.

5. If you are taking medication to control blood pressure, heart rate, or if you have not taken your medication as prescribed by your doctor on the day of the session, please inform the therapist proactively.

6. If you experience discomfort such as chest tightness, chest pain, dizziness, cold sweat, or feeling cold during rehabilitation exercises, please inform the therapist immediately.
