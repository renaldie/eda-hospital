## Importance of Energy-Saving Techniques

1. Energy-saving techniques (also known as work simplification techniques) help patients conserve energy by efficiently using their bodies and organizing actions, thereby maintaining independence in daily activities and reducing discomfort caused by illness.

2. Proper use of energy-saving techniques enables patients with breathing difficulties and shortness of breath during exercise to perform daily activities more easily. Combined with breathing exercises, these techniques can reduce the energy expenditure required during physical activities.
