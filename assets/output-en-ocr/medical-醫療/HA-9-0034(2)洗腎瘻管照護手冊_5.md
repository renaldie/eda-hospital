## ● Please seek medical attention or contact the dialysis unit immediately if any of the following situations occur:

1. Abnormal elevation of venous pressure during dialysis, indicating possible narrowing of the dialysis catheter.

2. Swelling in the arm with the dialysis catheter should raise suspicion of central venous obstruction or stenosis.

3. Redness or discharge from the arm with the dialysis catheter should raise suspicion of infection.

4. Coldness, numbness, or pain in the hand.

5. Skin wounds with bleeding risk.

6. Formation of a vascular tumor that is excessively large or abnormally enlarged.

7. Inability to feel pulsation or hear sounds in the dialysis catheter, which should raise suspicion of catheter obstruction.

8. Abnormal sounds from the dialysis catheter should raise suspicion of an impending obstruction.
