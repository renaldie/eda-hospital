## Infant Hearing Screening (AABR)

☐ Passed; routine pediatric outpatient visits and preventive vaccinations are sufficient; no additional follow-up is required.

☐ Failed; please follow up with an otolaryngology outpatient clinic for further evaluation.

## Doctor's Tips:

Hearing loss varies in severity. Only in cases of severe or profound hearing impairment do families typically notice it. Even mild hearing loss can lead to delayed language development. Therefore, we once again urge parents: infants who fail the hearing screening must be referred to an otolaryngology clinic for follow-up and evaluation. Do not assume that because your child can hear sounds, there is no hearing problem.
