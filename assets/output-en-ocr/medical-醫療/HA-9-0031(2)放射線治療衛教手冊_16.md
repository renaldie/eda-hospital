### 8. Prostate Cancer Radiation Therapy Care Guidelines

## (1) Definitions

Prostate cancer radiation therapy involves using high-energy X-rays to irradiate the tumor, causing it to shrink, and is considered a local treatment.

## (2) Applicable Population

Patients with prostate cancer who have been evaluated by a physician and require radiation therapy.

## (3) Side Effects and Care Methods

Organs adjacent to the prostate are the intestines and bladder. Therefore, prostate cancer patients most commonly experience side effects from radiation therapy, primarily gastrointestinal and urinary reactions. These symptoms are all within normal ranges.

| Gastrointestinal | If diarrhea or anal inflammation occurs, clean the anus with clean water after defecation, and avoid using toilet paper as much as possible to reduce anal irritation and skin breakdown. |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                  | During defecation, patients may experience a sensation of incomplete evacuation (feeling the urge to go even after defecation), and the doctor will prescribe an anal ointment based on the patient's condition. |
|                  | In severe diarrhea, increase fluid intake and consume easily digestible foods while avoiding spicy and irritating foods. |
| Urinary System   | If frequent urination occurs during treatment, in addition to the requirement of holding urine for 30 minutes during treatment, maintain adequate fluid intake during daily life and avoid holding urine. |
