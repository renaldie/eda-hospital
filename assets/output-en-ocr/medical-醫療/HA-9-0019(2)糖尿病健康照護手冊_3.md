4. Cooking should use plant-based oils and avoid animal fats; preferred cooking methods include steaming, boiling, cold-dressing, grilling, stewing, and pickling.

5. The diet of middle-aged and elderly individuals should not be overly salty, and they should limit intake of high-cholesterol foods such as internal organs, crab roe, shrimp roe, and fish roe. For patients with high cholesterol, egg yolks should not exceed 2–3 per week.

6. Choose high-fiber foods to slow down the rise of blood glucose.

7. Starchy foods such as sweet potatoes, potatoes, taro, corn, lotus seeds, chestnuts, red beans, green beans, fava beans, pumpkins, sweet paste, sushi, radish cake, curry dumplings should be consumed in moderation and not eaten arbitrarily.

8. Sugary snacks, condensed milk, honey, carbonated beverages, packaged or boxed fruit juices, preserved fruits, egg rolls, tapioca, wheat flour, noodles, bean threads, and rice vermicelli should be avoided as much as possible.

9. Avoid alcohol consumption.

10. Rice porridge and instant noodles should be consumed in minimal amounts.

11. Avoid foods with added sugar; individuals who enjoy sweet foods can use sugar substitutes (non-nutritive sweeteners) for flavoring.

12. Try to minimize attending banquets; if necessary, carefully select alternative food types and portion sizes.

## Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring

Due to fluctuations in blood glucose levels among diabetic patients caused by their physical condition, food intake, and medication absorption, relying solely on clinic glucose testing is insufficient. Patients must also use a glucometer to perform self-monitoring and record their glucose levels at home to help manage blood glucose and prevent hypoglycemia.

Although glucometers can provide timely glucose readings, they may be affected by factors such as test strip storage and operational technique. Therefore, regular calibration and verification of the glucometer are necessary.

## Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1C)

Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) is formed when glucose binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells. Red blood cells typically circulate in the body for about 120 days, so HbA1C can reflect average blood glucose levels over the three months prior to blood sampling. Higher levels indicate poor glucose control and serve as a key indicator of the effectiveness of diabetes management.
