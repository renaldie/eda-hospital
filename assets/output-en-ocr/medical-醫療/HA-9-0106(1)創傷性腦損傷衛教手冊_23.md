## IX. Care (continued)

(6) If there is a laceration on the head, apply bandaging and pressure to stop bleeding, and seek emergency medical treatment; after suturing, observe for signs of inflammation or infection such as redness, swelling, heat, and pain at the wound site.

(7) If clear or bloody fluid flows from the ear or nose, do not forcefully blow the nose or use cotton swabs to clean the ear. Immediately rest in bed and notify medical staff.

(8) If there is difficulty in movement or dizziness after injury, use walking aids or have someone assist when walking to avoid dizziness and falling again. Also monitor for any local neurological symptoms.
