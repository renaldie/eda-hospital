## II. Grading

Head injuries can be classified according to the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, which helps to understand the progression and severity of the disease:

## Mild head injury: GCS score 14–15

- Commonly seen in patients with minor intracranial bleeding or simple concussion. Symptoms may include confusion, visual disturbances, or balance issues. Some patients may experience persistent headaches, dizziness, memory loss, or emotional instability. These symptoms usually gradually improve and resolve over time.

## Moderate head injury: GCS score 9–13

• Requires hospitalization; some cases may require surgical intervention.

## Severe head injury: GCS score ≤8

• The condition is serious and requires surgical treatment, with a risk of death and a higher likelihood of postoperative complications.
