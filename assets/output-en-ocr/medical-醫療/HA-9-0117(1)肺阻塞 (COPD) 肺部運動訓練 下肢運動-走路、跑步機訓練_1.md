Walking exercise requires wearing appropriate footwear.

Individuals with poor balance may use a cane or walker for assistance.

If a home treadmill is available, it can be used to adjust to a suitable speed.

It is recommended to perform the exercise at least three times per week, each session lasting 15–20 minutes; the frequency and number of sessions can be adjusted according to individual conditions.
