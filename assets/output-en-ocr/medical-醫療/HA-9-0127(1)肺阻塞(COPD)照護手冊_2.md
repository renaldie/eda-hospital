## One. What is Emphysema

Emphysema (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the respiratory tract, characterized by irreversible obstructive lung disease. The primary cause of chronic inflammation is long-term irritation of the respiratory tract (such as smoking, dust, chemical substances, etc.). This inflammatory response leads to increased mucus secretion in the airways, resulting in bronchial obstruction and impaired gas exchange, causing breathing difficulties and other respiratory problems.
