## (4) Notes

a. During each treatment session, the bladder must be inflated for at least 30 minutes, and patients should develop a daily bowel habit to reduce side effects on the nearby bladder and rectum.

b. Avoid activities such as soaking in hot springs or warm baths during treatment, as heat sources may exacerbate inflammation.

C. Avoid prolonged sitting or cycling during treatment, as these activities may cause skin irritation or pressure.

d. After starting treatment, patients must visit the outpatient clinic at least once per week for a physician's evaluation of the treatment status. If discomfort occurs, the physician may prescribe medication based on the patient's condition to alleviate symptoms.

e. Application method of rectal ointment: apply a small amount of ointment around the outside of the anus, then attach the tube and insert it into the anus to squeeze a small amount of ointment inside, which can help reduce discomfort (as shown in Figure A below).
