## Diabetes Education

## I. What is Diabetes?

Diabetes is a systemic metabolic disorder, primarily caused by insufficient secretion or poor action of insulin in the body, leading to abnormal metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. This results in excessive glucose in the blood, which is excreted through the kidneys and appears in urine.

## II. What are the symptoms of diabetes?

Main symptoms include the commonly mentioned "three more": eating more, drinking more, and urinating more. Other typical symptoms include weight loss and fatigue. Additional symptoms may include skin itching, slow wound healing, numbness, tingling, or pain in the feet, and blurred vision.

## III. Who is at risk of developing diabetes?

Individuals with a family history of diabetes, those who are overweight, middle-aged and older adults, people who are physically inactive, individuals with high blood pressure or high cholesterol.

## IV. What types of diabetes are there?

## 1. Type 1 Diabetes:

This is an insulin-dependent type, typically occurring in children and individuals under the age of 30. Due to the pancreas being unable to produce insulin, most patients require lifelong insulin injections.

## 2. Type 2 Diabetes:

This is a non-insulin-dependent type, usually affecting adults over the age of 40, although it is now also affecting younger individuals. This type results from the dysfunction of beta cells ($\beta$ cell) and reduced insulin sensitivity in body cells. Type 2 diabetes often has a familial genetic background, and factors such as obesity, unhealthy lifestyle, and environmental risks further contribute to its development.
