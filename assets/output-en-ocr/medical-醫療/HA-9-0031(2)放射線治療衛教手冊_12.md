### 5. Breast Cancer Radiation Therapy Care Guidelines

## (1) Definitions

Breast cancer radiation therapy involves using high-energy X-rays to irradiate the breast tumor, causing it to shrink, and is considered a localized treatment.

## (2) Applicable Population

After partial or complete surgical removal of the breast tumor, patients who undergo radiation therapy following evaluation have a higher probability of local control, reduced recurrence risk, and prolonged survival.

## (3) Care and Precautions Before and After Treatment

Skin reactions are the most common side effects, typically appearing from the third week of treatment. The skin may appear slightly red and swollen, similar to sunburn, and the pores on the skin may become more visible. Therefore, self-care of the skin is particularly important.

| Moisturizing | Choose a suitable moisturizer without added fragrances or essential oils. |
| Moisturizer Application Range (as shown in Figure A): | Apply from the clavicle to the lower edge of the breast, and extend to the areas under the armpit and to the reach of the hand. |
| Frequency of Moisturizer Application | Apply 2 to 3 times daily; no need to wash off; allow to air dry naturally. |
| Recommendation | Avoid applying any products two hours before treatment. |
| Reduce Friction | After starting treatment, avoid wearing bras to prevent skin irritation from underwire or elastic bands. |
| Clothing Choice | Wear cotton and breathable clothing; avoid garments with collars or lace, which have excessive stitching. |
| Backpack Use | Avoid carrying a backpack on the affected side. When walking, keep the affected arm across your chest to reduce friction on the underarm skin. |
| Bathing | Bathe once a day; avoid using cleaning products on the treatment area. Simply rinse with plain water and pat dry with a towel. |
