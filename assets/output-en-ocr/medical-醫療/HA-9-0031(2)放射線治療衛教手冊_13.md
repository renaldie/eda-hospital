### b. Post-treatment Precautions

After starting treatment, patients must visit the outpatient clinic at least once per week for the doctor to assess the treatment status. If discomfort occurs, the doctor may prescribe medication based on the patient's condition to alleviate the symptoms.


| Medication Application | If more than two creams are used, they should be applied after waiting 15 minutes. |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                        | If the skin becomes red, cracked, or develops blisters, the doctor will prescribe a burn cream. Since burn cream is difficult to clean, it does not need to be completely washed off during bathing. Even if some cream remains, a new layer can be directly applied. |
|                        | The burn cream should be applied thickly enough to fully cover the skin so that it is no longer visible. After application, a gauze can be used to cover the area to prevent it from coming into contact with clothes. However, absolutely no adhesive tape should be used to stick to the skin, as removing the tape may cause the skin to be pulled off and result in skin damage. |
