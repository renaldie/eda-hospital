(6) Medical history:

Please inform the doctor in advance if you have a history of allergies (such as reaction to contrast agents) or conditions like uncontrolled bleeding.

### 2. During catheterization examination:

(1) Local disinfection and anesthesia will be performed. A special catheter will be inserted through a blood vessel in the arm or groin, and guided to the heart along the vessel.

(2) You will remain conscious throughout the procedure. During the process, you may be asked to cough forcefully to promote coronary artery blood flow.

(3) When the contrast agent is injected, you may feel a sensation of whole-body warmth, nausea, or vomiting. Please do not worry—this sensation will quickly subside.

(4) If you experience any discomfort such as chest tightness, chills, fever, palpitations, or shortness of breath during the procedure, please inform the medical or nursing staff.
