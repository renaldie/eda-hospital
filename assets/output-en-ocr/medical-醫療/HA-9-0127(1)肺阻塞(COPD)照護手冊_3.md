## What is pulmonary obstruction

Pulmonary obstruction ranks as the 9th leading cause of death in Taiwan (2022), causing over 5,000 deaths annually, accounting for 6%–10% of total mortality among the population, with a first-hospitalization mortality rate of 22%.

Common symptoms include "coughing, producing phlegm, and persistent shortness of breath," which are often mistaken for common cold or asthma symptoms and thus overlooked. If you have chronic coughing, expectoration, breathing difficulties, or a history of exposure to hazardous factors, it is recommended to seek medical attention for further examination and diagnosis.
