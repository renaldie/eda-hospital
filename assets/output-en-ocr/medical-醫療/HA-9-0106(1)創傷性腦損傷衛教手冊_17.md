## VII. Symptoms (continued)

Seizures are common complications of moderate to severe traumatic brain injury. They are caused by abnormal electrical discharges in the brain, resulting in involuntary movements and can be divided into two major types: generalized seizures and partial seizures.

## (1) Generalized Seizures

## ◆ Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizure

Generalized tonic-clonic seizure: A more severe and widespread seizure, during which stiffness and convulsive movements occur in all four limbs.

## Absence Seizure

A milder and smaller type of seizure, characterized by brief loss of consciousness, caused by sudden abnormal electrical discharges throughout the brain.

## ☑ Atonic Seizure

A sudden loss of muscle tone, causing the person to fall suddenly, often resulting in injuries or fractures.

## ◆ Myoclonic Seizure:

Brief and rapid shaking of the body or limbs, similar to being startled.
