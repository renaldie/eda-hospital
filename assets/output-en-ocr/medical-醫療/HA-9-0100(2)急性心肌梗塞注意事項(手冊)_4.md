### 4. Surgical Treatment -- Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG):

When the severity of coronary artery blockage makes balloon angioplasty or stent placement unsuitable, surgical intervention in the form of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is required to address myocardial ischemia and prevent sudden death due to myocardial infarction.

### 5. Medication Therapy:

Medication therapy can improve cardiac function, reduce episodes, and alleviate symptoms; however, it cannot restore the original diameter of narrowed vessels. Currently, several medications are available to increase oxygen supply or reduce oxygen demand, such as nitrates, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and antiplatelet drugs.

## Five. Precautions for Catheterization Procedures

1. Before catheterization:

(1) Physiological assessment:

Blood draw, electrocardiogram (ECG),  
X-ray examination.

(2) Informed consent:

Must include consent and signature from both the patient and family members.

(3) Skin preparation:

To reduce the risk of surgical site infection, it is generally recommended to shave the upper 3/4 of the arm, upper thigh, and both inguinal regions during the procedure.  
(Common catheterization sites include the wrist or inguinal area)

(4) Fasting:

Fasting is not required for emergency procedures. For procedures scheduled the next day, patients should fast after midnight (including water and food). For procedures scheduled in the afternoon of the following day, breakfast may be consumed before 7 AM, and fasting (including water and food) should begin after breakfast.
