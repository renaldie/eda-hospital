## Five. Surgical Treatment for Peripheral Arterial Occlusion

When medication cannot control the condition, doctors may recommend surgery to restore blood flow. Surgery can be divided into two types:

1. Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (commonly known as balloon angioplasty): In this procedure, the doctor makes a small incision through the skin of the ankle or hand, inserts a catheter into the blood vessel, passes it through the narrowed section, inflates a balloon to widen the vessel, and improves blood flow. Depending on the patient's vascular condition, the doctor may decide to place a stent to support the vessel. This surgery is performed under local anesthesia and has a quick recovery time.

2. Bypass Surgery: When the blockage is severe, the blocked vessel must be replaced with either the patient's own blood vessel or an artificial one. This procedure is used in such cases.
