## Importance of sarcopenia and grip strength training

1. Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterized by decreased muscle mass, strength, and function throughout the body. Studies have found that approximately 27% of COPD patients have sarcopenia.

2. Grip strength not only reflects hand muscle strength but also serves as the best indicator of overall muscle strength.

3. COPD patients with low grip strength and reduced skeletal and respiratory muscle function are at higher risk of acute exacerbations and mortality, leading to worsening lung function and reduced quality of life. Research shows that for every 1 kg decrease in grip strength, the risk of COPD deterioration increases by 5%.
