※ Pre-collection precautions:

Do not collect urine during menstruation in women.

※ Steps for 24-hour urine collection:

1. Discard the first urine void when starting collection (e.g., if collection begins at 8:00 a.m., void the bladder contents at 8:00 a.m.).

2. Collect the second urine void into the urine collection container and continue collecting urine until the final void at the same time the next day is collected, which constitutes the 24-hour urine sample.

3. During collection, keep the urine collection container refrigerated.

4. Record the total 24-hour urine volume on the first round-bottom urine tube. Mix the urine in the collection container thoroughly, and withdraw 10 c.c. into the first round-bottom urine tube. Submit the first round-bottom urine tube.

5. If the 24-hour period has not elapsed and the collection container is full, first record the total urine volume of the first container, withdraw 10 c.c. of urine into the first round-bottom urine tube, empty the container, and continue collecting urine until the 24-hour period ends. Record the total urine volume of the second container, and add it to the first container's total volume to obtain the total 24-hour urine volume. Record this total volume on the second round-bottom urine tube. Mix the urine from the second container thoroughly, and withdraw 10 c.c. into the second round-bottom urine tube. Submit both the first and second round-bottom urine tubes.

1. Submit the round-bottom urine tubes with the urine samples in a refrigerated manner (place ice blocks inside the transport bag) to the designated collection window, and confirm the total 24-hour urine volume with the receiving staff.
