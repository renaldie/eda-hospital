## Eight. Nutrition Care Guidelines

1. Choose fresh ingredients; avoid canned and various preserved or processed foods, and avoid soup broths and brine sauces.

2. Pay attention to foods with high sodium content but not easily noticeable, such as noodles, sweet pastes, and biscuits. If food contains alkaline substances, baking soda, baking powder, or salt, reduce their usage.

3. It is recommended to cook meals at home and reduce the frequency of eating out. Use natural aromatic seasonings such as vinegar, scallions, ginger, garlic, eight-cornered spices, and lemon juice to replace processed seasonings such as soy sauce paste, tomato sauce, and monosodium glutamate (MSG).

4. Limit intake of high-cholesterol foods such as organs, crab roe, and fish eggs. Individuals with high triglycerides should avoid high-fat and high-sugar foods such as French fries, oil cakes, cakes, Chinese pastries, chocolate, and ice cream.

5. It is recommended to choose whole grains and coarse grains, increasing the intake of unrefined foods such as sweet potatoes, brown rice, and pumpkin, and replacing white rice. Avoid refined sugar intake, such as fruit juice, beverages, candies, or pastries.
