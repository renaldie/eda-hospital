## IV. How to Reduce "Thirdhand Smoke"?

1. Most first-year students and some adults understand that secondhand smoke is harmful to health, but awareness of thirdhand smoke is limited. Many smokers open windows or use fans to disperse smoke odor, or smoke outdoors or wait until the smoke smell on their bodies has dissipated before going home. However, they are unaware that harmful substances from tobacco have already remained on their clothes.

2. Since exposure to tobacco smoke has no safe level, for the sake of one's own and family's health, smokers should quit smoking as soon as possible to effectively protect family members from the dangers of secondhand and thirdhand smoke.
