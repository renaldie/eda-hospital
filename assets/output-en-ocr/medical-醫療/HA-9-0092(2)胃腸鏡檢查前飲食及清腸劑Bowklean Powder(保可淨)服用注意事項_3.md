## 01 Natural Disasters

In response to natural disasters such as typhoons, if the high and Keelung areas announce a closure of operations on the day of the health check-up, services related to health examinations will be temporarily suspended for safety reasons. Subsequent rescheduling will be arranged by dedicated personnel. Enterprise clients are advised to contact the designated officer for further arrangements!

It is not recommended to perform tests on estrogen metabolism, feces, urine, or smear tests. Please schedule a follow-up examination at least 7 days after the end of menstruation. If you have confirmed pregnancy or are currently planning or possibly pregnant, these tests are not suitable and should be postponed!
