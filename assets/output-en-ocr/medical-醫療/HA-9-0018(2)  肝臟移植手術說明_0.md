## IV. Postoperative Precautions

(1) Monitor for signs of rejection or infection by daily measurement and recording of body temperature and blood pressure. Observe the frequency, color, and characteristics of urine and bowel movements (immediately inform the transplant team if tea-colored urine or grayish-white stools are observed).

(2) Maintain a normal and regular lifestyle.

(3) Practice good hygiene habits—both you and your family should maintain good hygiene, such as washing hands frequently, brushing teeth or rinsing the mouth after meals, etc.

(4) Avoid going to crowded places. If you must go to crowded areas, wear a mask for protection. Intense physical activities should be avoided until six months after surgery.

(5) Hepatitis B vaccination is a top priority both before and after liver transplantation. Inactivated vaccines should not be administered. The polio vaccine should be replaced with the inactivated form, i.e., the Salk vaccine.

(6) Avoid indoor plant cultivation or entering plant greenhouses to prevent infection from plant pathogens. Also, avoid keeping pets to reduce the risk of vector-borne infections. If diarrhea occurs and there are more than six watery bowel movements within 12 hours, do not use antidiarrheal agents; instead, return to the hospital for stool culture.

## V. Health Insurance Coverage Explanation

After approval by the Ministry of Health and Welfare for liver transplantation, the surgical procedure and postoperative immunosuppressive medications are covered by the national health insurance. However, Simulect (Noveltyl) injection, an immunosuppressive medication, is not covered by health insurance and will be used in two doses during the transplant procedure.
