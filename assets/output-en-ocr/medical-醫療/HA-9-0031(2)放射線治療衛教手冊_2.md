## One: Introduction to Radiation Therapy

Radiation therapy is a method of treating cancer and can also be used to treat certain benign conditions. In Taiwan, radiation therapy is commonly abbreviated as "electrotherapy" or "radiotherapy," which may be confused with physical therapy using electrical stimulation in rehabilitation or electrocoagulation therapy for liver tumors. In fact, due to the term "electric light" being used in Hokkien (a variant of Taiwanese dialect) to refer to X-rays, the phrase "treatment by electric light" (in Hokkien) is commonly shortened to "electrotherapy."

In recent years, beyond the conventional X-ray therapy widely recognized by the public, Taiwan's medical community has introduced advanced forms of particle radiation, such as proton and heavy particle therapy. Regardless of the specific treatment method or the source of radiation, patients undergoing radiation therapy do not experience any sensation—such as pain, vision, taste, or touch—similar to undergoing diagnostic imaging procedures in the radiology department.

In an era emphasizing personalized medicine, radiation therapy has long adopted patient-specific treatment strategies. Modern radiation therapy uses medical tomographic imaging to precisely map the location of each patient's tumor and the shape of surrounding normal organs, enabling effective concentration of radiation dose on the target area while minimizing impact on healthy tissues. Radiation therapy can be used independently for curative treatment or combined with other cancer therapies—for example, to enhance treatment efficacy through concurrent chemoradiation or to synergize with immunotherapy to trigger a systemic immune response. For early-stage cancer patients who are not suitable for surgery or who personally refuse surgical intervention, stereotactic radiation therapy is also a viable alternative option.
