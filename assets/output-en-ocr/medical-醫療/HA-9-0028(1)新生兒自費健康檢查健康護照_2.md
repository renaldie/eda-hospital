## *Cord Blood Allergy Index Test

☐ IGE > 0.9, the baby has a high allergic constitution; please refer to the health education section to reduce the occurrence of allergic diseases.

☐ IGE < 0.9, the baby has a low allergic constitution; if allergic symptoms appear, please visit the pediatric outpatient clinic.

## Doctor's Tip:

In infants under one year old, allergic symptoms most commonly manifest in the skin (atopic dermatitis) and gastrointestinal tract (colic). As the child grows older, respiratory allergic symptoms gradually develop, including asthma and allergic rhinitis. If your baby has any of the above conditions, in addition to referring to the cord blood allergy test results, we still recommend that you visit the pediatric outpatient clinic for further consultation and prevention.
