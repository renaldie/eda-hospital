## Understanding Bone Density Testing

## I. The Relationship Between Bone Density and Osteoporosis

1. In our human skeletal tissue, there are two important types of cells: osteoblasts (which are like construction workers) and osteoclasts (which are like demolition workers). In youth, osteoblast activity exceeds that of osteoclasts (construction workers work more and faster than demolition workers), resulting in higher bone density and healthier bones.

2. However, after the age of 40, osteoblasts decline faster than osteoclasts (demolition workers work more and faster than construction workers), leading to a gradual decrease in bone content and lower bone density.

3. Understanding bone density testing methods

## (a) Common Bone Density Testing Instruments:

Due to differences in the body parts being examined, the most commonly used bone density testing methods today are primarily divided into the following two:

(b) X-ray examination: While general X-ray examinations have clinical diagnostic reference value, they only show abnormalities when bone loss reaches over 30%. Therefore, X-ray testing is not suitable for early diagnosis of osteoporosis.

  

|  | Initial Screening | Further Testing |
|---|---|---|
| Testing Instrument Name | Peripheral Quantitative Ultrasound (QUS) | Central (or Semi-axis) Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) |
| Examination Site | Heel, finger, radius, tibia | Spine, hip, forearm, femoral neck, whole body |
| Advantages | 1. Can measure bone density, microstructural integrity, and elasticity. <br> 2. No radiation, shorter testing time. <br> 3. Affordable and portable. | 1. Low radiation exposure. <br> 2. Small error margin and high accuracy. <br> 3. The current standard method for bone density testing. |
| Disadvantages | 1. Cannot measure spinal or hip bones. <br> 2. Results may vary depending on the testing site and angle, so it can only serve as an initial screening tool. If abnormalities are detected, further confirmation via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is required. | May be affected by skeletal diseases such as lumbar bone spurs, aortic calcification, or compression fractures. |

(c) The clinical diagnosis of osteoporosis currently follows the T-score (T-value) standard established by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1994.

(d) What is the T-score (T-value)? It refers to the calculation obtained by subtracting the average bone density of young adults from the measured bone density of the subject, then dividing by the standard deviation of bone density in young adults. The resulting T-value indicates the degree of bone loss as shown in the following table.

| Bone Density Test Result | Degree of Bone Loss | Recommended Actions |
|---|---|---|
| T-value ≥ -1 (normal standard value) | Normal bone density | Congratulations! Your "bone strength" is normal. Please continue to consume calcium and maintain healthy lifestyle and exercise habits! |
| -1 > T-value ≥ -2.5 | Insufficient bone density | Increase intake of calcium-rich foods, take calcium supplements, and engage in moderate physical activity. |
| T-value < -2.5 | Osteoporosis | Avoid unhealthy lifestyle habits, prevent falls or external impacts to avoid fractures. Also, discuss with a doctor whether medication treatment is necessary. |
| T-value < -2.5 and has previously experienced hip or spinal fractures | Severe osteoporosis | |

Example: A 55-year-old Asian woman has a T-value below -2.5, indicating that she is diagnosed with osteoporosis.

(e) BQI (Bone Quality Index): During ultrasound testing, the bone quality index is calculated based on the speed of sound wave transmission and the attenuation value. This value represents bone density (the higher the bone density, the faster the sound wave speed).
