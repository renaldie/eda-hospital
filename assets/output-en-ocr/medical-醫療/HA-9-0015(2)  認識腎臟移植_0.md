Types of organs and usage precautions, nutritional intake, and other related matters are also discussed. We also hope that family members can cooperate and understand the post-transplant care needs of the patient. After kidney transplantation, self-care, medication adherence, and regular outpatient follow-ups require a support system from family and friends—this directly affects the success rate of kidney transplantation.

## Who are the members of the hospital's transplant team?

1. Transplant surgeon  
2. Organ transplant coordinator  
3. Clinical specialty nurse  
4. Transplant ward nurses

Each medical professional has distinct roles and responsibilities. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to ask. This will allow the transplant team to understand your specific needs and provide you with the most appropriate support.

Overall, kidney transplantation not only eliminates the suffering of dialysis treatment, reduces dietary restrictions, and extends life expectancy, but also enables patients to enjoy a normal quality of life. However, since post-transplant patients must take immunosuppressive medications for life, a professional and thorough evaluation is required before deciding to undergo kidney transplantation. After surgery, close cooperation and regular follow-up with the transplant team are essential to prevent graft rejection and the side effects of immunosuppressive drugs.
