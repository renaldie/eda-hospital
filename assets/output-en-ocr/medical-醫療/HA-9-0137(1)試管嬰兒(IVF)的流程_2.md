| Day 2 of next menstrual cycle | Take oral estrogen | Stimulate endometrial proliferation • Take medication continuously for 12 days (do not miss or forget doses; if missed, take the missed dose immediately with food) | |
| Day 13 | • Continue taking estrogen (E2) • Perform vaginal ultrasound | Endometrial thickness and shape should reach optimal implantation timing • Endometrial thickness ≥0.8 cm is suitable for embryo implantation. • The doctor will discuss with the patient to determine the embryo grade for implantation. • The timing of implantation will be decided based on embryo culture days. | |
| From Day 13 onwards | Supplement progesterone | Enhance progesterone function • To stabilize the uterine lining, progesterone supplementation is required for approximately 14-16 days after embryo implantation to support embryo implantation. | |
