## Prostate Health

## I. What is the Prostate?

The prostate is an organ in the male reproductive system, located below the bladder and at the end of the urethra. It secretes prostate fluid, which is part of semen.

## II. Enlarged Prostate?

Men typically begin to show signs of an enlarged prostate between the ages of 35 and 45. The exact cause remains a mystery, but generally, it is one of the phenomena that occur as human organs age.

## III. How to Detect Prostate Problems?

If you experience any of the following six symptoms, you should suspect that your prostate may be having problems:

1. A weak, thin urine stream during urination, sometimes with interruptions.
2. After finishing urination, there is still a dripping of urine that cannot be fully emptied.
3. Frequent urges to urinate, resulting in incontinence.
4. A feeling that the bladder is not fully emptied, even after urination, and a persistent urge to urinate.
5. Increased frequency of urination, especially needing to get up several times at night to urinate.

## IV. How to Maintain Prostate Health?

Men cannot prevent the onset of an enlarged prostate, as it is inevitable in middle and older age. However, they can prevent its worsening and avoid developing urinary problems.

1. Avoid staying in the same position—sitting, standing, or squatting—for more than 30 minutes. Prolonged posture with the feet below the hips can cause congestion in the pelvic and lower limb areas, leading to prostate enlargement and urethral narrowing, making urination more difficult.

2. Sexual activity does not worsen an enlarged prostate; in fact, regular sexual activity can help slow the progression of prostate enlargement.

3. Men with prostate enlargement should empty their bladder before sexual activity.  
After ejaculation, the bladder neck constricts, which can make urination difficult.

4. Men with prostate enlargement should avoid taking antihistamine medications, such as motion sickness pills, allergy medications, cold remedies, and anti-diarrheal drugs. These medications affect nerve function, causing the urethra to constrict. If this leads to inability to urinate, one must seek hospital treatment immediately and have a catheter inserted for urination.

5. Avoid holding urine for long periods. Limit intake of beverages such as coffee, tea, or beer. Try to avoid drinking large amounts of water at night.

6. Men over the age of 50 should undergo regular health check-ups to monitor their prostate health, enabling early detection and timely treatment.

7. In daily diet, follow the principle of light and nutritious food. Recommended supplements include pumpkin seeds and seed-based foods, vitamin E, and zinc supplements.
