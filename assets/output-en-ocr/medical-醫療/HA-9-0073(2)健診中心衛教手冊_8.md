## Low purine diet (diet for hyperuricemia/gout)

## I. Dietary principles

1. Proteins in food are broken down into "purines" during digestion. Purines are then metabolized by the liver into "uric acid," which is finally excreted from the body through the kidneys. Approximately 85% of uric acid in the human body is produced internally. Therefore, in addition to maintaining a balanced intake of the six major food groups and limiting high-purine foods, patients should also receive medication for control and maintain an ideal body weight.

2. Maintain an ideal body weight. When overweight, weight loss should be gradual, with a recommended loss of 1–2 kilograms per month. Avoid extreme dieting, as rapid tissue breakdown can produce large amounts of uric acid and ketone bodies, triggering gout attacks. Weight loss is not recommended during acute attacks.

3. To prevent excessive uric acid production, protein intake should be controlled. The recommended intake is 1 gram of protein per kilogram of body weight per day.

4. During acute attacks, protein should ideally come solely from egg, milk, or dairy products, and should be selected from low-purine foods. Please refer to the food selection table (Table 1).

5. High-fat diets inhibit uric acid excretion. Therefore, cooking fats should be used in moderation, and fried or pan-fried foods should be avoided. Cooking methods such as steaming, boiling, roasting, pickling, cold-pressed, and microwave cooking are recommended.

6. When appetite is poor, small amounts of sugary liquids (such as honey or fruit juice) may be provided to prevent insufficient caloric intake, which could lead to accelerated fat breakdown and reduced uric acid excretion. (Diabetic patients should not use this.)

7. Even outside of acute attacks, high-purine foods should be limited. Moderate intake of medium-purine foods is acceptable, and dried beans should be consumed as little as possible. Daily intake should primarily consist of low-purine foods.

8. High-fat diets inhibit uric acid excretion. Therefore, cooking fats should be used in moderation, and fried or pan-fried foods should be avoided. Fat intake should be less than 30% of total energy intake.

9. Alcohol and high-fructose beverages: Alcohol and beverages containing high-fructose corn syrup are metabolized into lactic acid in the body, which affects uric acid excretion and accelerates uric acid formation.

## 10. Avoid overeating.

11. Patients should drink plenty of water to aid uric acid excretion. It is recommended to consume at least 3,000 milliliters of liquid daily.

12. The metabolic byproducts of cocoa, coffee, and tea do not accumulate in body tissues. Moderate consumption can increase fluid intake and accelerate uric acid excretion.

13. Moderate consumption of tofu has been shown to alter plasma protein concentration and increase uric acid clearance and excretion.
