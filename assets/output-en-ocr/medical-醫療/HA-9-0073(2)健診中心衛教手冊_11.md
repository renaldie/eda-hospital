## Chapter Twelve: Duodenal Ulcer

## I. Definition

Ulceration of the duodenal bulb and second part due to erosion by gastric acid is known as "duodenal ulcer."

## II. Symptoms

1. Pain occurs in the upper central area of the abdomen.

2. The typical pain of duodenal ulcer occurs 3 to 5 hours after eating, when the stomach is empty—this is known as "hunger pain."

3. When there is sudden massive bleeding, vomiting blood may occur.

## III. Complications: Consider surgical treatment if any of the following complications are present.

1. Perforation of the ulcer.

2. Massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

3. Persistent pain.

4. Pyloric stenosis or outlet obstruction.

## IV. Prevention and Health Care Methods:

1. Avoid smoking, alcohol, and stimulating foods such as tea, coffee, chili, or overly acidic or sweet foods.

2. Eat meals at regular times and in fixed quantities, and consume more meat or fish.

3. Avoid staying up late; try to go to bed before 10:30 p.m. If you must stay up late, eat an extra meal.

4. Avoid liquid foods unless there is bleeding.

5. Maintain a relaxed mood and reduce stress.

6. Take antacids as prescribed by a doctor.

7. If there is Helicobacter pylori infection, additional antibiotic treatment is required.

## V. Dietary Principles

Food selection for peptic ulcers is divided into three stages depending on the severity of the ulcer:

First stage: From the time of bleeding to after hemostasis (1–3 days). Milk or cold liquid foods should be consumed.

Second stage: From 1–3 days after hemostasis to the recovery period. Soft foods or mild diets are recommended.

Third stage: During the recovery period. A normal diet can be adopted, and it is best to consume a variety of food types.
