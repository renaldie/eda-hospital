## Five. Assessment (continued)

## (2) Light Reflex

The pupils are generally assessed for shape, size, and reactivity; when exposed to bright light, the pupils constrict. However, when one eye is illuminated, the other eye will also exhibit a pupillary constriction reflex.

The light reflex test evaluates the optic nerve and oculomotor nerve. Head trauma often leads to visual dysfunction, and another key aspect is assessing the oculomotor nerve function. If there is an intracranial lesion with expansion, oculomotor nerve function serves as a valuable indicator.
