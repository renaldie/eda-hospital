## Stage Two: Outpatient Rehabilitation in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation

It is recommended that patients undergo at least six weeks of rehabilitation training, three times per week, after discharge. The physical therapist will develop a rehabilitation plan based on the patient's specific training goals, which includes:

1. Warm-up exercises

- Light resistance training  
- Limb mobility  
- Perceived exertion score < 8

2. Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation exercises

- Treadmill walking, cycling, hand-pedaling, or other prescribed activities  
- Perceived exertion score ≤ 13

3. Mild exercises

- Light mild exercises  
- Flexibility exercises  
- Perceived exertion score < 8

| Score | Perceived Exertion Level |
|-------|--------------------------|
| 6     | No exertion at all       |
| 7     | Extremely light          |
| 8     | Very light (row span 2)  |
| 9     | Very light (row span 2)  |
| 10    | Light                    |
| 11    | Can still sing during exercise |
| 12    | Slightly difficult       |
| 13    | Can still talk, cannot sing |
| 14    | Difficult                |
| 15    | Speaking becomes wheezing during exercise |
| 16    | Very difficult           |
| 17    | Speaking becomes difficult during exercise |
| 18    | Extremely difficult (row span 2) |
| 19    | Extremely difficult (row span 2) |
| 20    | Already giving maximum effort |

The physical therapist will continuously monitor vital signs throughout the process to ensure patient safety. Patients are not allowed to participate in rehabilitation exercises if their resting blood pressure is <90/50 mmHg or >160/90 mmHg, or if their heart rate is <50 or >100 bpm.

During this stage, patients may perform light household activities such as sweeping, mopping, and cooking, and may engage in sexual activity with the physician's approval.

## Six: Important Notes and Precautions for Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation

## Stage Two: Outpatient Rehabilitation in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation

## Process for Accepting Outpatient Rehabilitation:

After discharge, patients should return to the cardiology clinic for follow-up. If the physician determines that the patient is suitable for rehabilitation, they will be referred to the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. The rehabilitation physician will conduct an assessment, provide health education, and issue medical instructions. The physical therapist will then implement the cardiopulmonary rehabilitation program and provide related health education.

## Stage Three: Community and Home-Based Rehabilitation

Patients should, in the absence of chest pain or discomfort, develop regular exercise habits at home or in nearby community centers, schools, or gyms, such as brisk walking, jogging, cycling, swimming, dancing, or Tai Chi. The frequency should be at least three times per week, with each session lasting over 30 minutes.
