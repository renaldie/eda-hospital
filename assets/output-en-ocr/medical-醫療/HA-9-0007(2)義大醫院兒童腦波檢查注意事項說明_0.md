## Children's EEG Examination Guidelines

## I. Introduction to EEG Examination

What is an EEG examination? An EEG examination involves placing electrodes on the scalp to record the brain's electrical activity, which is then displayed as waveforms. The principle is similar to an electrocardiogram (ECG). EEG examinations are completely painless and non-invasive. Typically, an EEG includes two parts: awake EEG and sleep EEG. The duration of each examination is approximately 40–60 minutes.

Why is an EEG examination performed? Children may exhibit symptoms such as seizures, absence episodes, abnormal sensations, involuntary movements, coma, changes in consciousness, developmental delay, headaches, dizziness, or other abnormalities. These symptoms may lead doctors to suspect underlying brain disorders, and thus an EEG examination is arranged to detect any abnormal electrical brain activity (indicating possible brain abnormalities). Based on the child's symptoms and the EEG results, clinicians can make a more accurate diagnosis and proceed with appropriate treatment or further investigations.

Why perform a sleep EEG? Generally, if the brain has abnormal electrical discharges, these are more easily detected during sleep. Therefore, a sleep EEG significantly increases the sensitivity of the EEG examination.

## II. Pre-examination Precautions:

If preparation is inadequate and the examination cannot be completed, a second examination may be required. Please cooperate accordingly.

1. On the night before the examination, wash the child's hair clean and avoid applying hair oil or hair gel.

2. Please wake the child up at ___ year ___ month ___ day at ___ o'clock. After waking, encourage the child to move around as much as possible and avoid making them fall back asleep. No fasting is required; avoid going without food. Do not drink excessive water. If a sleep EEG is scheduled, avoid consuming stimulant beverages such as coffee, tea, or soda.

3. Bring the child to the pediatric examination room at the agreed time in an awake state. Please ensure the child has used the restroom before the examination begins.

4. For children under three years old, you may bring items needed for the child to fall asleep (such as milk, warm water, pacifier, blanket, or quiet toys, etc.).

5. For young children or those who are unable to follow instructions, parents should accompany the child to comfort and assist during the examination. Parents should turn off their mobile phones. If the child has younger siblings, please avoid bringing them to the examination to prevent interference.

6. Sedative medication may be administered, if necessary, to help the child fall asleep.

## III. Precautions During the Examination:

1. First, an awake EEG is performed on the examination bed, followed by a sleep EEG (depending on the individual case) $ ^{°} $ 

2. During the examination, please do not knock on the door, as this may interfere with the results.

3. Family members should wait outside in the waiting chair. If you need to leave temporarily, please inform the reception staff and provide your contact phone number.
