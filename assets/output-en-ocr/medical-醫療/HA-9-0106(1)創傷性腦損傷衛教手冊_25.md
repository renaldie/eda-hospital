## IX. Care (continued)

✓ Absolutely do not force any object into the patient's mouth: If the patient is in a rigid state and cannot open their mouth, or if their jaw is clenched, do not insert your hand into the patient's mouth or force any object into their mouth for them to bite.

√ Assist the patient's breathing: After the seizure has ended, if the patient is lying on their back, turn them onto their side. The tongue may fall forward and block the airway. Turning the head to one side helps prevent saliva or vomit from blocking the airway and causing aspiration.

The Taiwan Epilepsy Medical Society, in collaboration with "Ibi Duck Duck," promotes and advocates a simple mnemonic to help epileptic patients perform optimal first aid.

Remove sharp objects from around the patient. If soft cushions or clothing are available, place them under the patient's head. Do not forcibly restrain the patient's limbs, and do not insert foreign objects such as pens or towels into the patient's mouth to prevent biting the tongue.

Turn the patient's face to the side to allow saliva and secretions to drain out, preventing blockage of the airway.

Stay with the patient until they regain consciousness and inform them about the seizure.

If the patient has continuous convulsions lasting more than five minutes, or if consciousness does not return after repeated seizures, the patient should be taken to a medical facility for treatment.
