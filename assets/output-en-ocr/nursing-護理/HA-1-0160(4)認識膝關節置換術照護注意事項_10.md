## II. Should anticoagulant medications be stopped before surgery?

Which anticoagulant medications should be temporarily discontinued before joint replacement surgery? For how long should they be stopped?

Many elderly patients with joint degeneration also have cardiovascular diseases and are currently taking antithrombotic medications. These drugs provide cardiovascular protection and help prevent tragic events such as heart attacks and strokes. The decision to stop or continue these medications hinges on balancing the benefits against the risks.

"Before undergoing any surgery, please inform your doctor about the medications you are currently taking."

Please proactively discuss this with your doctor and do not make decisions about medication use on your own.
