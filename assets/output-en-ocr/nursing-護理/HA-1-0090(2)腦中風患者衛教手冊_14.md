## Advantages

- Extensive clinical experience in use

- Effectively controls clotting within a safe therapeutic range, resulting in fewer side effects

- In case of overdose or bleeding, physicians can use vitamin K as an antidote

Note

- Narrow therapeutic window

- Interactions with various foods and medications

- Patients need regular blood monitoring to maintain appropriate INR (assesses coagulation function; higher INR values indicate increased bleeding risk)

- Some patients may be highly sensitive to warfarin or develop resistance to it

- Use in elderly patients increases the risk of bleeding
