Delirium is an acute, short-term state of mental confusion, typically caused by "physiological abnormalities."  
Most cases can be improved by addressing the underlying triggers, and symptoms can gradually resolve. If not improved, it may lead to substantial medical costs, serious complications such as falls, pressure injuries, prolonged hospital stays, higher likelihood of admission to long-term care facilities, and even increased mortality rates.
