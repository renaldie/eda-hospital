## Six. How to handle fever in adults?

1. If the fever lasts for one or two days and then resolves on its own, there is usually no need for excessive concern. Simply rest and drink plenty of fluids.

2. If fever is accompanied by chills, difficulty breathing, or if you have recently returned from an epidemic area, seek medical attention immediately.

3. If the fever persists for more than two to three days, or if there are no other symptoms but the fever continues, this may be a sign of infection or another illness. Seek medical attention immediately.
