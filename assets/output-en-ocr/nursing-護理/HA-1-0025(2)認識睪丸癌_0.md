## Seven. Prognosis:

The prognosis of testicular cancer is relatively good when compared to other urinary system tumors. For seminoma, if the first-stage patient undergoes orchiectomy and radiotherapy, the five-year survival rate reaches as high as 98%. For stage II A, the survival rate is 92–94%, while for advanced stages, it is approximately 35–75%. For non-seminoma, the five-year survival rate reaches 96–100% in stage IA, 90% in stage IB, and even 55–80% in cases with lymph node or distant metastasis. Therefore, as long as the condition is detected early and treated early, the chance of cure is quite high.

## Postoperative Care and Health Education:

1. Upon transfer from the recovery room to the ward, pay close attention to vital signs and mental status assessment.

2. Nursing staff will monitor your ability to urinate spontaneously. Due to anesthesia, increased fluid intake postoperatively, and patients' fear of pain, most patients should be able to urinate within 6–8 hours after surgery. If no urination occurs, nursing staff will first assess whether the bladder is distended, then apply heat therapy, encourage urination, and perform catheterization if necessary.

3. There will be a surgical incision on the scrotum, covered with gauze and under pressure. Do not attempt to remove the sutures yourself; keep the wound dry.

4. Nursing staff will assist you in applying ice packs to the testicular area to reduce pain and swelling. Use a supportive device to alleviate discomfort.

5. Exercise: Patients can get out of bed the day after surgery as per medical instructions. Avoid strenuous physical activity until the wound has healed (approximately one week). Sexual activity can resume after three months.

6. Medication awareness: Understand the effects and side effects of medications and take them as prescribed.

7. Home care:

(1) The wound does not require suture removal; sutures will be absorbed naturally. Apply topical ointment daily, and avoid water exposure for 5–7 days to maintain cleanliness and dryness.

(2) During the healing period, avoid soaking in a bathtub; only take showers to prevent infection.

(3) Take medications as prescribed.

(4) Return to outpatient clinic for follow-up at the scheduled appointment.

(5) Maintain a balanced diet and avoid spicy foods.

(6) Attend regular outpatient follow-up visits.
