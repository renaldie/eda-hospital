## Intramuscular or intravenous injection (non-steroidal or morphine-based analgesics):

Each person has different pain tolerance and absorption efficiency, with time limitations. These methods require administration at fixed intervals as instructed by the doctor, or for sudden, acute pain requiring immediate relief.

Multimodal analgesia: Evaluated and prescribed by an anesthesiologist, this method selects the appropriate drug and route of administration. It uses machines or intravenous/local delivery, sets safe dosages and lock-in times, and allows patients to choose their preferred treatment.
