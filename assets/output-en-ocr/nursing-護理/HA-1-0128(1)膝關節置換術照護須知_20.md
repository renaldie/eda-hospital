## IV. Postoperative Medications

## (I) Prophylactic Antibiotics

1. Surgical prophylactic antibiotics refer to the administration of antibiotics to patients before surgery, prior to wound contamination or infection, in order to prevent postoperative infections.

2. Possible side effects such as allergies or gastrointestinal discomfort—such as skin rash, itching, or diarrhea—should be reported immediately to the medical team if they occur.

## (II) Antithrombotic Medications

1. To prevent the occurrence of deep vein thrombosis, physicians will assess the patient's condition after surgery and decide whether to prescribe antithrombotic medications (such as antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants).

2. If you have a history of gastrointestinal bleeding or peptic ulcers, please inform the medical team in advance.

3. During medication use, if you are scheduled to undergo any surgical procedures, tooth extraction, endoscopy, or other procedures or examinations that may cause bleeding, please inform your doctor in advance about your current use of these medications.

4. While taking antithrombotic medications, be cautious during daily activities to avoid injury. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush or an electric razor when brushing teeth or shaving.
