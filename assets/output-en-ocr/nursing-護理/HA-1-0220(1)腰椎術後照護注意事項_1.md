## I. Postoperative Complications

Patients undergoing lumbar surgery may experience complications such as wound inflammation, infection, or nerve damage.

## II. Postoperative Care

1. After surgery, pay close attention to changes in arm and leg nerve function. If you experience numbness, weakness, or reduced mobility, notify medical staff immediately.

2. Be careful to avoid pulling or tugging at the drainage tubes on your body. Keep the wound dry and closely monitor the dressing for any signs of blood or pale yellow fluid leakage. If leakage is observed, notify medical staff immediately.

3. Nursing staff will assess your urination and defecation every 2–4 hours and monitor for signs of urinary retention.

4. After surgery, pain and discomfort due to swelling at the surgical site pressing on nerve roots are common. Inform the nursing staff so that appropriate pain medication can be administered as needed.

5. The wound is sutured out 7–10 days after surgery. After removal, use cosmetic adhesive tape for protection. Increase intake of high-protein and high-vitamin foods to promote wound healing.
