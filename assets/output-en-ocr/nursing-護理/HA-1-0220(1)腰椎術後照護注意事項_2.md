## Three. Postoperative Activities

### 1. Bed Rest Precautions:

(1) Follow the doctor's instructions regarding when to get out of bed. If you are still required to remain in bed for within 48 hours after surgery, change positions at least every 2 hours using the rolling method (Figure 1). If using a commode on the bed, ensure the buttocks are not elevated. When lying flat, place a pillow under the head and another under the knees to maintain spinal alignment. With the doctor's permission and if no discomfort is felt, gradually elevate the head of the bed to prevent orthostatic hypotension, but be cautious not to press on the surgical site.

Step the opposite foot onto the bed, then turn over

(2) Bedside activities: During bed rest, hip and knee joint movements can be gradually increased within the pain tolerance range of the surgical wound. Movements of the upper limbs, feet, and ankles do not affect the affected area and should be performed as much as possible, at least five times per day, to prevent deep vein thrombosis.

### 2. Correct Posture Transitions:

(1) During hospitalization to reduce wound pain:

a. Raise the head of the bed to maintain the stability and alignment of the surgical area.

b. Turn to the side and sit at the edge of the bed, supporting the bed surface with both hands.

c. Family members assist in protecting the patient.
