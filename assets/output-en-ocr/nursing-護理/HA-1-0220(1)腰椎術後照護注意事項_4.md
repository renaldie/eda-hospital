## (2) Lying on the bed posture:

a. When lying on the side, bend the knee joints.

b. When lying on the back, place a pillow under the knees, and use a flat pillow under the head to avoid tension in the shoulders, neck, and arms.

c. Avoid the prone position, as this posture causes the back to sink and leads to tension in the shoulders and neck.

d. When getting on or off the bed, maintain a straight line of the lumbar spine, and ensure the back brace is worn before getting off the bed.

(3) Proper sitting posture:

a. The chair should have a solid backrest. The width and height of the chair should be appropriate so that both legs naturally bend and hang freely to the ground, with the knee joints ideally higher than the hip joints.

b. Avoid low and soft chairs, such as soft sofas or low stools.

c. Do not sit abruptly on the chair; avoid prolonged sitting (more than 30 minutes), and contract the abdominal muscles to straighten the back, keeping the neck and back in a straight line as much as possible.

d. When driving, keep the seat backrest at a reasonable distance from the steering wheel, and fasten the seat belt or use a firm backrest.

## Five. Rehabilitation exercises:

1. Begin practicing the basic rehabilitation exercises from the initial stage of the teaching sheet before surgery. Advanced rehabilitation exercises are performed only after being assessed and guided by a therapist during hospitalization, and can be continued after discharge and returning home.

2. When wearing a back brace, if the back panel causes discomfort at the surgical wound, place a towel inside the back panel. The soft towel can reduce wound pain and improve comfort.

3. During exercise, follow the principle of not causing pain at the surgical wound. If pain occurs, consult a physical therapist to adjust the exercise plan.

4. If dizziness or discomfort occurs, pause the exercise to prevent falls. Exercise intensity should be tailored to individual conditions and should not be excessive, as overexertion may cause pain at the surgical wound.

5. Benefits of exercise: After surgery, combining rehabilitation exercises with recovery can improve surgical success rates and reduce the recurrence of back pain.

6. Exercise prescription: Hold each exercise for 10–15 seconds, then relax. Perform 15 repetitions, four times a day.
