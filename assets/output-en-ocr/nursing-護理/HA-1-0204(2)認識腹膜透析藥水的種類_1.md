(6) In peritoneal dialysis solutions, calcium ion concentration is divided into two types: regular calcium and low-calcium formulations. The choice between these formulations should be made by a physician based on the patient's blood calcium level.

(7) The volume of peritoneal dialysis solution varies. The dual-bag system currently offers two specifications: 2000 cc and 2500 cc; the fully automated dialysis system currently offers two specifications: 2500 cc and 5000 cc.

Two, Non-glucose peritoneal dialysis solutions:

(1) 7.5% Enteral is a starch-based polysaccharide polymer that is metabolized and absorbed more slowly in the body. For long-term dwell, one bag should be retained for at least 8 hours to achieve optimal fluid removal. It is recommended to use this solution before bedtime or during prolonged daytime activities. A single bag can be retained for 8 to 16 hours, resulting in fluid removal of approximately 400 to 1000 ml.

(2) After metabolism, starch-based polysaccharide polymers are converted into maltose, which can interfere with blood glucose measurements and cause false high glucose readings. Glucose oxidase test strips must be used for accurate detection.

(3) According to the National Health Insurance regulations, one bag per day is prescribed for patients with poor fluid removal, diabetic patients with hemoglobin A1c greater than 7, or those who have developed peritonitis.
