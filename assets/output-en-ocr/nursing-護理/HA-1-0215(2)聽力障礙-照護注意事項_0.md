## Hearing Impairment - Care Considerations

## ➢ Classification of Hearing Loss:

1. Sensory-neural hearing loss: Causes occur in the inner ear or auditory nerve, such as: exposure to loud noise, occupational injuries, ototoxic drugs, inner ear viral infections, inner ear lymphedema, presbycusis (age-related hearing loss), etc.

2. Conductive hearing loss: Causes occur in the outer or middle ear, such as: earwax blockage, foreign bodies or tumors in the ear canal, middle ear abscess or fluid accumulation, etc.

3. Mixed hearing loss: Combination of both sensory-neural and conductive hearing loss.
