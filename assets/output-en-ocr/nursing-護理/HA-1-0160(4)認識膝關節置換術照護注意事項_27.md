Can be improved by adjusting the dosage.

3. Use patient-controlled analgesia (PCA): The goal of treatment is to use the minimum amount of medication so that the patient does not feel pain while lying in bed, although mild pain may still be felt during severe coughing or movement, with the pain being significantly reduced.

4. Duration of PCA use: Pain gradually decreases over 2–3 days after surgery. Oral analgesics can then be switched to, and PCA can be discontinued.

5. Differences between PCA and traditional analgesia:

(1) PCA delivers medication continuously through a machine; patients can press a button themselves when experiencing particularly severe pain to reduce it.

(2) Traditional analgesia is administered only when pain becomes intolerable; the medication starts working after 30 minutes and lasts for 4–6 hours.

6. The anesthesiologist will set the dosage and timing of PCA based on the patient's individual conditions, and will continuously monitor the patient's condition during use to adjust the dosage accordingly. Therefore, addiction or overdose is avoided.

7. The anesthesiologist will assess the patient's condition. PCA is contraindicated if the patient shows signs of altered consciousness, low blood pressure, hypovolemia, or septic shock.

8. Traditional analgesia is covered by the national health insurance; PCA is not covered and must be paid for out-of-pocket.
