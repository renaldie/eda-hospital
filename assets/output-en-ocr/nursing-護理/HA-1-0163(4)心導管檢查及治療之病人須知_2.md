## One: What is Coronary Artery Disease

The terrifying nature of cardiovascular disease lies in the fact that patients may suddenly die without warning, leaving people completely unprepared. Most members of the general public often overlook the possibility of a sudden cardiac event. The most common form of heart disease in adults is narrowing and blockage of the coronary arteries, medically known as coronary artery disease—commonly referred to as angina. Like all organs in the body, the heart requires blood vessels to supply oxygen-rich blood. The heart receives oxygen-rich blood through three coronary arteries. As long as these vessels remain healthy, the heart can maintain normal function. However, when the coronary arteries narrow or become blocked, reducing oxygen supply to the heart muscle, chest pain occurs. The heart muscle becomes oxygen-deprived, leading to impaired contraction and reduced blood output. In severe cases, the conduction system responsible for regulating heart rhythm may be damaged, resulting in heart failure or arrhythmia, which can ultimately lead to death.

## Two: Types and Methods of Treatment

## Generally, medical treatment is broadly divided into:

## (1) Prevention and Control of Risk Factors

This includes avoiding high-fat and high-cholesterol foods, adopting a low-salt diet, increasing intake of vegetables and fruits, controlling blood pressure, managing blood sugar levels, completely quitting smoking, maintaining a regular lifestyle, and engaging in regular physical activity. The ideal exercise regimen is to exercise three times per week, for 30 minutes each session.

## (2) Medication Therapy

Medication therapy can improve heart function, reduce the frequency of episodes, and alleviate symptoms. However, it cannot restore narrowed arteries. Currently, several types of medications are available to either increase oxygen supply to the heart or reduce oxygen demand, such as nitrates, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and antiplatelet agents.

## (3) Interventional Treatments

If medication therapy is ineffective, patients may undergo catheterization to assess whether the lesion is suitable for percutaneous interventions such as balloon angioplasty or stent placement, or whether coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery is required.
