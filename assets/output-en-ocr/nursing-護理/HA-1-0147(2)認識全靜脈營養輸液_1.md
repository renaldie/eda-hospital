## What is Total Parenteral Nutrition?

Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) involves delivering the body's required proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals through large blood vessels via a high-nutrient, high-concentration solution to maintain bodily needs. The so-called "nutrition injection" typically refers only to a solution containing glucose and a small amount of amino acids (proteins) administered intravenously. This is quite different in concentration from total parenteral nutrition.

1. Carbohydrates: Provide energy.

2. Lipid emulsions: Provide energy.

3. Amino acids: Support tissue repair.

4. Electrolytes: Sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, phosphate, acetate.

5. Vitamins: Both fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins.

## Who needs total parenteral nutrition?

1. Cancer patients with insufficient food intake due to illness or treatment, requiring improvement in nutritional status.

2. Patients who need temporary fasting or have gastrointestinal dysfunction, receiving nutritional support via intravenous means.

3. Severe trauma: such as burns or severe abdominal trauma.

4. Patients diagnosed with moderate to severe malnutrition.

5. Newborns with congenital abnormalities: such as short bowel syndrome.

6. Preterm infants: with low birth weight.
