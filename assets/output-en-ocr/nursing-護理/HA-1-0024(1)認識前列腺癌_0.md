Perform adequate fluid and blood transfusions, and use vasopressors as needed, to stabilize the circulatory status.

(二) Care of the catheter: After surgery, a 30 cc urethral catheter is left in the urethra to apply pressure and promote hemostasis at the wound site. Prevent blockage, bending, or twisting of the catheter; keep the catheter clamp closed. The urine collection bag should not be placed on the floor or above the waist level. Secure the catheter to the bedside and avoid pulling or tugging.

(三) Traction and fixation: When there is significant bleeding, the urethral catheter is traction-fixed to achieve hemostasis. The traction limb should remain straight. The thigh and knee joints where the catheter is fixed should not be bent, as this may alter the traction force and lead to bleeding. Due to catheter traction, patients may experience pain and a sensation of needing to defecate. If any discomfort occurs, inform the nursing staff. Pain relief medication may be administered by the physician as needed.

(四) Activity restriction: To prevent bleeding from the wound, patients should remain in bed for 24 hours post-surgery.

(五) Use of analgesics and sedatives: As the urethral catheter may cause pain, analgesics may be administered as prescribed by the physician.

(六) Bladder irrigation: If clots or tissue fragments cause urinary retention, bladder irrigation will be performed.

(七) To stabilize the circulatory status, follow the physician's instructions for adequate fluid and blood transfusions, and use vasopressors as needed, to maintain stable circulation.

## Eight. Home Care Instructions:

1. After the medical staff removes the urinary catheter post-surgery, if you experience urgency to urinate, incontinence, frequent urination, painful urination, or mild hematuria, these are temporary postoperative phenomena. Continue outpatient treatment for three months; symptoms will gradually resolve.

2. Avoid constipation. Eat more fruits, vegetables, and fruits, or take soft stool agents as prescribed by your doctor. Avoid unnecessary enemas.

3. For three months after surgery, avoid riding bicycles, motorcycles, prolonged squatting, warm sitz baths, going up and down stairs, running, or any activities involving abdominal strain.

4. Drink plenty of water during the day, but limit intake at night. Aim for approximately 2000 cc of urine output per day.

5. If you experience persistent large-volume hematuria, seek medical attention immediately.
