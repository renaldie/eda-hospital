## Three. How Catheterization is Performed

Cardiac catheterization involves using specially designed sterile catheters inserted through the femoral artery (in the thigh, near the knee) or the radial artery (in the wrist) to examine the coronary arteries for stenosis or blockages. If a stenotic lesion is found, percutaneous balloon angioplasty may be performed to expand the narrowed area, or a stent may be implanted.

### 1. Balloon Angioplasty

(1) Place the guiding catheter at the opening of the coronary artery: as shown in the left image below

(2) Insert the wire through the guiding catheter: as shown in the right image below

(3) Advance the balloon catheter along the wire to the site of the lesion: as shown in the left image below

(4) Inflate the balloon to expand the narrowed segment: as shown in the right image below

(5) Repeat balloon inflation multiple times:

(6) Remove the balloon catheter and assess the expansion effect of the vessel to determine whether further stent placement is needed: as shown in the right image below
