## Acute Otitis Media

## I. Definition

Acute otitis media refers to a sudden, short-term condition involving infection, inflammation, or the presence of fluid in the middle ear cavity.

## II. Causes

Acute otitis media is often a complication of respiratory infections caused by bacteria or viruses. When the throat or nose becomes infected, bacteria or viruses can travel through the eustachian tube into the middle ear, leading to otitis media.

## III. Symptoms

1. The ear may feel full or painful, severely affecting sleep and daily routines.  
2. Fever.  
3. Difficulty hearing.  
4. The membrane inside the eardrum may rupture, causing fluid to leak from the ear (otorrhea).

## IV. Treatment Methods

1. The primary treatment for acute otitis media is to prevent complications caused by bacterial infection. Doctors will prescribe appropriate antibiotics to be taken for 7–14 days.  
2. It is necessary to use appropriate fever-reducing and pain-relieving medications, which can alleviate pain and reduce body temperature, making the patient more comfortable.  
3. If pain persists after antibiotic treatment and the eardrum remains swollen, the doctor may consider surgical intervention.

## V. Precautions

1. When experiencing nasal discomfort, such as nasal mucus blocking the nasal passages, do not forcefully blow your nose or suck out the mucus. Doing so when the nose is blocked may push bacteria or viruses into the middle ear, triggering inflammation.  
3. After recovery from acute otitis media, it is essential to have a follow-up examination with a doctor, as some patients may develop chronic inflammation or fluid accumulation in the middle ear. In severe cases, this can lead to hearing loss and require further treatment.
