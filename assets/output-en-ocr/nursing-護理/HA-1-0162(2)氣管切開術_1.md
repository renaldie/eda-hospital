## Tracheostomy

## I. What is tracheostomy?

Tracheostomy (commonly referred to as "trach") involves making a small incision between the first and second, or third and fourth, tracheal cartilages in the neck, and inserting a tracheostomy tube to maintain a clear airway.

## II. Who needs tracheostomy? When is it best performed?

(1) Patients with endotracheal tubes in place for more than 14 days, who have been evaluated by a physician and deemed to require early tracheostomy to facilitate weaning off the ventilator.

(2) Patients requiring long-term use of a ventilator, such as those in a coma.

(3) Upper airway obstruction due to conditions such as tumors.

(4) Long-term bedridden patients who cannot clear secretions independently and repeatedly suffer from aspiration pneumonia.

(5) Patients who have previously failed attempts to remove endotracheal tubes.

(6) A small number of patients may require early surgery (within seven days), such as those with upper airway obstruction, head and neck trauma, coma, or paralysis requiring long-term bed rest.

## III. Why is tracheostomy performed?

(1) It reduces the risk of oral infections, facilitates oral hygiene, and decreases the incidence of oral ulcers.

(2) The patient's mouth can close, leading to greater comfort and avoiding mucosal dryness caused by prolonged mouth opening.

(3) It reduces resistance in the artificial airway, facilitating earlier weaning from the ventilator.

(4) It makes suctioning of respiratory secretions easier, thereby reducing the risk of pneumonia.

(5) The tracheostomy tube is less likely to dislodge or shift, making it safer.

(6) For patients with conscious awareness and normal swallowing function, oral feeding can be achieved after appropriate training and adaptation.

(7) Special tracheostomy tubes can allow patients to speak, enhancing their communication abilities.

## IV. Is tracheostomy dangerous?

(1) The surgical procedure typically takes about 30 minutes.

(2) Tracheostomy is generally safe, even in diabetic patients. Potential complications include bleeding at the incision site, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, tracheal stenosis, infection, laryngeal injury, pain, and swallowing difficulties. Most of these complications can be effectively managed with appropriate interventions.

## V. Can tracheostomy guarantee weaning off the ventilator?

Tracheostomy does not guarantee successful weaning from the ventilator, but the success rate is higher than that of endotracheal tubes, and it significantly improves the patient's quality of life.

## VI. Will the tracheostomy wound remain for life?

After evaluation by a physician and removal of the tracheostomy tube, the wound typically heals on its own within a short period of time (varying from person to person). In a small number of cases, if healing does not occur spontaneously, medical interventions can be used to promote recovery.

## VII. Can food be eaten through a tracheostomy?

Since the trachea is located anteriorly and the esophagus posteriorly, patients can eat normally. During swallowing, the vocal cords close to seal off the trachea, ensuring that food enters the esophagus without affecting breathing.

## VIII. Can the tracheostomy tube be removed?

When the reason for tracheostomy (such as the need for a ventilator or excessive secretions) is resolved, the tracheostomy tube can be removed. The incision site typically heals spontaneously within 7 to 10 days.
