## VIII. How to Use a Walker

1. Adjust the walker height so that your elbows are slightly bent at 20 degrees.

2. Move the walker forward first, then step out with the affected limb.

3. Shift your body weight onto the foot that hasn't undergone surgery (please note that both feet should be aligned with the shoulders and at the same width).

4. Move both hands to advance the walker by one step, ensuring the distance is not too large to prevent instability and falls.

5. Hold the walker to support your body, stepping forward with the affected limb into the red zone to achieve the most stable walking posture.

6. Then, take one step forward with the non-surgical foot, without stepping beyond the affected limb—this is the safest walking method.

Reminder! Taking large steps increases the risk of falling.
