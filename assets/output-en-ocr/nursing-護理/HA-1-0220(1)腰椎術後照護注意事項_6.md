## Post-surgical nutrition promotes faster wound healing and reduces body aches and pains

The key to diet after spinal surgery lies in bone and muscle recovery.  
Consuming high-quality protein, calcium, iron, zinc, and vitamins helps wound healing and maintains healthy muscles and bones.  
Moreover, due to reduced physical activity post-surgery, adequate dietary fiber intake is essential to promote gut health!
