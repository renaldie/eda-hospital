## Introduction to Tracheostomy

▶ Tracheostomy involves making an opening in the tracheal ring to connect it with the trachea, known as a tracheostomy stoma, commonly referred to as "tracheostomy" in short.

1. Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation  
2. Medical conditions necessitating long-term dependence on a ventilator  
3. Patients at risk of airway obstruction at any time

## Difference between Tracheostomy and Endotracheal Tube

## Tracheostomy Tube

Placement site  
Inserted through the neck tracheostomy stoma, not through the mouth, resulting in better oral hygiene.

Lower risk of tube placement complications  
The tube can be removed by releasing the cuff and reinserted quickly and safely, with a short procedure and low risk.

## Shorter tube length  
The tracheostomy tube is shorter, leading to better sputum clearance, easier breathing, and a higher likelihood of weaning off the ventilator.

Quality of life  
With proper training, patients can speak and eat, enabling better communication.

## Endotracheal Tube

Placement site  
The tube passes through the mouth, throat, and into the trachea, resulting in poorer oral hygiene and increased risk of mucosal damage.

Higher risk of tube placement complications  
The tube is inserted after confirming the tracheal position using a laryngoscope, resulting in a longer procedure and higher risk.

## Longer tube length  
The endotracheal tube is longer, making sputum clearance difficult, breathing more laborious, and reducing the likelihood of weaning off the ventilator.

## Quality of life  
Patients cannot speak or eat, leading to prolonged tube placement, potential swelling of the throat, and damage to the vocal cords.
