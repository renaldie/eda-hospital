## Two. Understanding Total Hip Replacement

## One. Introduction

The hip joint is the joint connecting the pelvis and thigh, composed of the acetabulum and femoral head. It is a crucial joint for walking and daily movement. When the hip joint is damaged to the point of causing pain during walking and weakness in the affected limb, severe cases may result in difficulty walking. Initial outpatient management typically involves medication and physical therapy. If pain or deformity persists despite medication and rehabilitation, leading to impaired mobility, total hip replacement surgery is required.

## Two. What is Total Hip Replacement?

A total artificial hip joint is designed to mimic the human hip joint structure and replace a diseased or damaged joint. It consists of an artificial acetabular component, an artificial femoral head, an artificial acetabular liner, and an artificial femoral stem. This construct provides a more stable hip joint, effectively reducing pain and improving joint mobility.

## Three. Indications

1. Congenital hip dysplasia  
2. Degenerative hip arthritis  
3. Rheumatoid hip arthritis  
4. Traumatic hip arthritis  
5. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head  
6. Femoral neck fracture
