## VI. Post-surgical care guidelines

## 1. Postoperative limb positioning and care instructions

1. After surgery, to prevent swelling of the affected limb, pain, and peripheral circulation disorders, nursing staff will assist the patient in elevating the affected limb using a pillow or cotton blanket and applying ice packs.

2. Do not use supports or pillows under the knee of the affected limb, as this may cause knee contracture and prevent the leg from straightening properly.

3. Frequently change the position of ice application on the affected knee to avoid icing the knee joint or icing both knees simultaneously, which could lead to circulatory disorders. Ice application should be stopped after the patient goes to sleep at night.

4. To prevent fever and inadequate lung expansion, patients should perform deep breathing and coughing exercises regularly. Nursing staff will assist in teaching the patient to turn over and pat the back every two hours (avoiding the waist and spine). Patients are encouraged to increase fluid intake to 2000–3000 ml per day (except for patients with fluid restrictions).

5. Raise the head of the bed by approximately 30 to 45 degrees to facilitate eating and prevent vomiting-induced aspiration.
