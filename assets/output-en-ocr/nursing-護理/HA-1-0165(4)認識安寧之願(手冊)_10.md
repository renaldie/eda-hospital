## Termination of financial deposit accounts or property name changes

Each financial institution has its own regulations; patients may inquire directly with the financial institutions they have dealings with. For property name changes, patients can seek advice directly from the land and property office or the tax bureau, or they may hire a notary public to handle the matter.

Reminder Record

## Termination of various insurance policies

Insurance companies or institutions record the beneficiary's name when a policy is purchased. Beneficiaries may apply for compensation or assistance payments according to the specific regulations of each insurance company or institution. Required documents include: the insurance policy, a death certificate, the beneficiary's identification card, and a notarized seal certificate.
