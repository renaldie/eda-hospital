## Droplet Precautions

Definition:

Droplet precautions are used to reduce the risk of pathogen transmission via droplets. These typically occur when the mucous membranes of the mouth or nose or the respiratory tract come into close contact with infectious secretions (e.g., novel A-type influenza, influenza, adenovirus, etc.). Droplets generally lose their infectivity beyond 1 meter, so special HVAC treatment is not required to prevent droplet transmission.

## Applicable to Your Protocol

| Precaution | Droplet Precaution |
|-----------|--------------------|
| Handwashing | ✓ |
| Gloves | ✓ as appropriate |
| Masks, face shields | ✓ |

| Infectious waste bags | ✓ as appropriate |
| Infectious trash bins | ✓ as appropriate |
| Single room | ✓ for same-type cases |
| Environmental disinfection |  |
| Negative pressure isolation room |  |
| Restricted access |  |

## Airborne Precautions

Definition:

Airborne precautions are used to prevent the spread of pathogens that are transmitted through long-distance airborne particles (e.g., measles virus, varicella-zoster virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, SARS-CoV, etc.). Patients requiring airborne precautions should ideally be placed in a respiratory isolation room (negative pressure isolation room).

## Contact Precautions

Definition:

Contact precautions are primarily used to prevent the spread of pathogens through direct or indirect contact with patients or through the care environment (e.g., scabies, patients with drug-resistant strains, etc.). These are applied in situations where the environment contains large amounts of exudate from wounds, incontinence, fecal or urinary excretions, or other human secretions, which may increase the risk of transmission or expand environmental contamination.
