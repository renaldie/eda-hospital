## 2. Preventing Catheter Exit Site Infections

1. Maintain personal and environmental hygiene, and change into clean clothes daily.

2. Take a daily shower; during showering, wear a disposable ostomy bag to prevent water contamination. After showering, promptly perform catheter exit site care to keep the area dry.

3. Avoid soaking in baths, hot tubs, warm baths, or swimming, as these easily lead to catheter exit site infections.

4. Do not shower when the catheter exit site has not fully healed after new catheter placement or if there are signs of infection. For the upper body, use a damp towel to wipe; for the lower body, rinse with clean water to avoid wetting the catheter exit site, which could lead to more severe infections.

5. If the catheter exit site becomes wet or dirty, change the dressing as soon as possible, especially during hot and humid summer months when sweating is heavy.

6. When performing catheter exit site care, do not turn on air conditioning or fans, as airborne dust may contaminate the exit site.

7. If the catheter exit site shows redness, swelling, heat, pain, discharge, or ulceration, seek immediate treatment at the peritoneal dialysis room and increase the frequency of dressing changes.

8. Do not apply non-prescribed ointments, powders, petroleum jelly, creams, or other topical medications to the catheter exit site without a doctor's prescription.

9. Secure the catheter to prevent pulling; do not tie your waistband at or near the catheter exit site. Avoid friction or scratching the exit site. If skin itching occurs, request a prescribed anti-itch cream from your doctor.

10. Use a secure dressing to fix the catheter and protect it.

## 4. Exercise

1. Before exercising, secure the catheter. Suitable activities include walking, brisk walking, hiking, cycling, qigong, dancing (such as folk dance or slow social dances), and warm-up exercises.

2. Avoid the following activities:

(1) Exercises that may pull on the peritoneal dialysis catheter, such as sit-ups, boxing, or martial arts.

(2) Activities that may cause displacement of the abdominal catheter, such as inverted positions or leg lifts.
