First, address the causes of delirium, such as treating infections, adjusting medications, managing pain, resolving constipation or urinary retention. If the patient is overly agitated or disruptive during treatment, low-dose antipsychotic medications may be given.

| 1. | Provide sufficient fluids and nutrition to maintain electrolyte balance. Serve foods the patient likes, but first consult the medical and nursing team about which foods are contraindicated. |
| 2. | Use aids such as glasses, hearing aids, writing boards, or picture cards to facilitate communication. Communicate using low-pitched, gentle tones and short, clear sentences. |
| 3. | Keep curtains open during the day and frequently remind the patient of the current date, time, location, floor, reason for hospitalization, and current treatments. |
| 4. | Use clocks, watches, calendars, and familiar items such as photos or radios to enhance orientation regarding people, time, place, and objects. |
| 5. | Increase daytime activities to maintain alertness and avoid drowsiness. Examples include going for walks, sunbathing, interacting with family members, playing familiar music, watching TV, or participating in community activities. |
| 6. | Assist the patient to get out of bed or sit in a wheelchair or perform limb exercises at least three times a day to reduce daytime bed rest and prevent complications such as pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. |
| 7. | Provide appropriate rest and sleep at night, but avoid excessive or inappropriate use of sedatives or sleep aids. |
| 8. | Avoid physical restraints unless absolutely necessary, as physical restraint may increase the patient's emotional agitation and restrict movement, leading to functional decline. |
