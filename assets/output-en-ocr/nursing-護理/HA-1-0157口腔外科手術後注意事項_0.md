# Postoperative Care for Oral Surgery

## Hemostasis

☐ Mild bleeding or blood streaks in saliva within the first 1-2 days after surgery is normal. If bleeding continues after removing gauze, place a damp gauze over the wound and bite down for one hour. If bleeding persists, seek immediate medical attention.

☐ A foreign body sensation in the mouth should not be addressed by licking the wound with the tongue. Avoid intense physical activity or prolonged exposure to sunlight to prevent bleeding from the wound.

## Postoperative Pain

□ Pain is subjective and varies from person to person based on individual pain tolerance. Therefore, your surgeon will prescribe pain medication to alleviate discomfort. Take pain medication as directed by your doctor when needed.

☐ Generally, the pain is most intense within 12 hours after tooth extraction and gradually decreases over time, with pain levels typically easing within 2–3 days.

## Postoperative Swelling

☐ Swelling after tooth extraction varies from person to person. Typically, swelling is most pronounced 2–3 days after surgery and then gradually subsides.

☐ After tooth extraction, apply ice packs for 20 minutes, followed by a 20-minute rest period. After 48 hours, if swelling does not worsen, switch to warm compresses. Apply warm compresses for 30 minutes, 3–4 times daily, until swelling or bruising disappears.

☐ After removing a lower molar with impaction, swelling may cause difficulty opening the mouth. This limitation in mouth opening usually resolves within about two weeks.

## Facial Bruising

☐ Sometimes, bruising may appear on the cheek or neck after tooth extraction due to bleeding seeping into the tissue spaces. This is generally harmless and can be alleviated with warm compresses.

## Diet

☐ For patients under general anesthesia, eating can begin once gas passage or hunger is felt. Before eating, try drinking a small amount of warm water. If no nausea or vomiting occurs, start with liquid foods such as milk shakes or clear porridge.

☐ Do not use straws before suture removal, as using a straw may create negative pressure inside the mouth, potentially dislodging blood clots and causing re-bleeding.

☐ For the first 2–3 days after surgery, consume soft, warm, or cool foods. Avoid hard, hot, or spicy foods, and do not consume supplements.

## Oral Hygiene

☐ Normal brushing of teeth can begin 24 hours after surgery. Use a cotton swab to clean the extraction site and sutures to prevent infection.

☐ After brushing, use mouthwash to maintain oral hygiene.

☐ Absolutely avoid smoking, drinking alcohol, or chewing betel nut after surgery, as these may lead to bleeding and poor wound healing.

## If any of the following occur, please contact your doctor or visit the outpatient clinic:

$ ^{*} $ Persistent bleeding from the surgical site exceeding 24 hours, even after applying pressure with gauze.

* Severe pain or increasing swelling at the surgical site within the first 2–3 days.

$ ^{*} $ Persistent high fever or alternating chills after surgery.

* If gastrointestinal discomfort or skin itching occurs after taking medication, stop taking the medication and inform your doctor.

## Postoperative Follow-up

* A follow-up visit to the clinic is recommended on the day after surgery if necessary.

$ ^{*} $ If sutures are placed, they should be removed 7–10 days after tooth extraction.
