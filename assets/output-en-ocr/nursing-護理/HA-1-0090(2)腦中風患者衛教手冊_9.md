## Stroke Risk Factors

## Other Diseases

## Hypertension

Approximately 50% of strokes are caused by hypertension.

☑ Easily damages the inner lining of blood vessels, leading to cholesterol accumulation and thus accelerating vascular hardening  
◆ Increases the risk of rupturing blood vessels, raising the danger of intracranial hemorrhage

## Diabetes

The risk of stroke increases by 1.5 to 3 times.

It causes vascular degeneration, increased blood viscosity, and vascular hardening. When occurring in the brain, it often results in atherosclerosis of coronary arteries, peripheral arteries, and cerebral arteries, as well as small vessel disease.

## Heart Disease

When the heart muscle or valves have lesions or arrhythmias, blood flow becomes obstructed and prone to clotting, eventually leading to cerebral embolism.

## High Lipid Levels

➢ High lipid levels are one of the key causes of vascular hardening.  
Elevated cholesterol and triglycerides cause arterial hardening, thereby increasing the risk of stroke.

Some stroke risk factors  
can be improved through lifestyle modifications.  
For example: controlling hypertension, diabetes, and high lipid levels, etc.
