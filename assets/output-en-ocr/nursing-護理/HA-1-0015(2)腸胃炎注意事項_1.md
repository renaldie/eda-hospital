## Gastroenteritis Precautions

## 1. Definition of Gastroenteritis:

Gastroenteritis is a disease caused by inflammation of the mucosa in the stomach or intestines. Common causes include food poisoning, ingestion of food or water contaminated with various viruses, bacteria, or parasites, excessive alcohol consumption, allergies, and emotional disorders.

## 2. Applicable Population:

1. Patients with gastroenteritis and their caregivers.

## 3. Symptoms:

1. Severe vomiting and diarrhea, often accompanied by abdominal cramps and colicky pain.

2. Fever and sweating.

3. Possible dehydration and even shock due to prolonged and excessive loss of body fluids.

4. Trace blood may be present in vomit or stool.

5. Vomiting and diarrhea symptoms typically subside within two to four days, although they may persist for a longer period in some cases.

## 4. Precautions:

1. If experiencing nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or fever, fast and only consume small amounts of plain water and electrolyte solutions. Rest in bed to aid recovery of strength.

2. If no vomiting occurs but diarrhea persists, only consume clear liquids such as fruit juice, sports drinks, or rice porridge. Avoid stimulants like tea, coffee, lemon juice, or orange juice, as these may irritate the gastrointestinal tract and trigger further vomiting.

3. After vomiting, rinse your mouth to reduce unpleasant odors.

4. Minimize milk consumption, as it may have a mild laxative effect. During the early stages or mild diarrhea, diluted regular infant formula may be used. If symptoms do not improve or if there is severe or prolonged diarrhea, specialized gastroenteric formula for 2–8 weeks may be required.

5. After diarrhea stops and if hunger is felt, gradually consume small amounts of light, easily digestible foods such as porridge or white toast. However, avoid drinking liquids simultaneously.

6. During the period when symptoms have not fully resolved, avoid consuming alcohol, coffee, tea, and oily, spicy, or irritating foods. Soft drinks, fresh milk, and fruits (except apples) should also be consumed sparingly (ideally avoided altogether).

7. Strictly follow medical instructions for taking medication at prescribed times and in prescribed doses. If symptoms persist after completing the medication, seek follow-up treatment at a clinic.

8. If there is skin damage around the anus, apply a lubricant (such as petroleum jelly) around the anal area before each bowel movement to reduce friction. After defecation, clean the area with warm water to reduce pain and discomfort during bowel movements.

## 5. Prevention and Health Knowledge:

1. Properly prepare food to reduce the risk of inflammation due to food contamination:

(1) Wash hands thoroughly before cooking or eating.

(2) Food must be fully heated and boiled before consumption.

(3) Separate cutting boards used for raw and cooked foods.

(4) Store food in the refrigerator and cover it with containers to protect against contamination by insects and other contaminants.

2. Dairy products such as cow's milk and cheese, as well as processed fish and meat products, should not be consumed if left at room temperature for too long. Pay attention to the expiration dates of food.

3. Avoid consuming unhygienic food, especially seafood and raw sushi that are improperly handled.

4. Cooked meat stored in the refrigerator should be thoroughly reheated before consumption.

5. If a canned food container is damaged, swollen, or if the contents appear abnormal, discard it immediately.

6. When heating food in a microwave, ensure the center reaches a sufficiently high temperature before consumption (microwaves do not have sterilizing capabilities).
