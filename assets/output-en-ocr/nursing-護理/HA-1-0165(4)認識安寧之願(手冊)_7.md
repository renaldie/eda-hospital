## You can try releasing and expressing emotions; methods to alleviate grief include:

1. You can cry out loud and avoid suppressing your emotions.

2. You can talk about things related to the deceased.

3. You can look at old photos, relive joyful and painful memories, and find emotional comfort.

4. Under a doctor's prescription, you can use sedatives or antidepressants at appropriate times to ease grief-related emotions.

4. You can call someone who can listen to you speak.

5. Depending on the child's condition, you can try discussing the reality of the patient's death with them, without hiding or evading the topic, because children will not stop thinking about death or the deceased.

## End-of-life care

1. Prepare a basin, towel, warm water, paper tape, gauze (as needed), a clean set of clothes that can be easily put on and taken off, and diapers.

2. Gently bathe the patient with warm water to clean their body, ideally while explaining the process to them.

3. If the eyes cannot close, gently tell the patient to "rest peacefully" near the ear, or use paper tape to cover them. After rigor mortis sets in, remove the tape gently; it should be removed after 8 hours (staff from funeral services can assist with this).

4. If the mouth cannot close, place a folded towel or cloth roll under the chin, and slightly elevate the head to tilt the neck forward so that the mouth naturally closes (remove after 8 hours).

5. To prevent gastric contents from flowing out when moving the body, place a large towel under the head and shoulders during cleaning to facilitate wiping and avoid soiling clothing with gastric contents.

6. If there is swelling or skin rupture, use a care pad or towel to wrap the swollen area to prevent exudate from soaking through clean clothes.
