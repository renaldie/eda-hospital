## II. Wound Care After Returning Home

1. Wash hands before and after touching the wound.

2. Wound disinfection or cleaning should be performed from inside out, without back-and-forth rubbing. The disinfection area should extend approximately 5 cm beyond the wound boundary. When changing the dressing, try to minimize the exposure of the wound to air.

3. Change the dressing once daily (it can be done after bathing). However, if there is blood soaking through the gauze, the gauze gets wet by accident, or the gauze falls off, the dressing must be changed immediately.

4. Keep the wound and gauze clean and dry. Avoid bathing or getting the wound wet. Try to use wiping instead of soaking.

5. Items needed for dressing change:

(1) 20 ml normal saline solution: use once and discard immediately after use.

(2) $ 4 \times 4 $ gauze

(3) Sterile cotton swabs

(4) Water-soluble povidone-iodine: keep for one week after opening.

(5) 3M paper tape: if allergic to paper tape, choose an anti-allergy tape instead.

(6) 6-inch elastic bandage (can be washed and reused).
