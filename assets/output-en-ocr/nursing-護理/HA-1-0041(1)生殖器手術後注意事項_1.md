## Post-operative Care for Genital Surgery

## ___Doctor

## I. Post-operative Care for Circumcision:

☐ Keep the surgical wound clean and dry. When urinating, be careful not to wet the gauze. If the gauze becomes wet with urine, remove it first before returning to the clinic for dressing change.

☐ After surgery, the penis may swell and there may be oozing and crust formation—these are normal post-operative phenomena. Please do not panic. Symptoms usually subside within 3 days.

☐ Circumcision procedures use absorbable sutures that do not require removal. The sutures will naturally fall off on their own.

☐ Do not attempt to remove the crust yourself, as this may lead to bleeding. Allow the crust to fall off naturally.

☐ There are no activity restrictions after surgery. Wear loose-fitting pants to avoid friction and discomfort.

☐ Patients who undergo circumcision should avoid sexual activity for 4 weeks and avoid erections as much as possible during this period.

☐ If you experience persistent bleeding from the wound, wound dehiscence, abnormal skin color, or a fever above 38°C that lasts for more than 3 days, please return to the clinic immediately for further examination and treatment.

## II. Post-operative Care for Vasectomy:

☐ Keep the surgical site clean and dry. After two days, you may take a shower and can apply topical ointment for self-care.

Wound care instructions:

☐ Clean the wound 1–2 times daily. First, use a sterile cotton swab dipped in normal saline to wipe away secretions from the wound. Wipe in a circular motion from the center of the wound outward—do not wipe back and forth. After cleaning, apply 1–2 mm of thin ointment, then cover the wound with a sterile gauze pad. Do not touch the central area of the gauze, as this may lead to wound infection.

☐ The sutures will naturally fall off within 10–14 days. No suture removal is required. You may resume normal work and sexual activity. It typically takes about 12–20 ejaculations before sperm are no longer present. Therefore, contraception is still necessary for approximately three months after surgery (since sperm stored in the seminal vesicles prior to surgery may still be present). A follow-up semen analysis at the clinic is required to confirm the absence of sperm before considering the procedure fully effective.

☐ The testicles may temporarily swell after surgery. The accumulated sperm will eventually be reabsorbed and broken down into nutrients, and the pain will subside.

☐ Sexual activity can resume once the wound has fully healed.

If a small amount of fresh blood appears after surgery, such as a coin-sized spot (either five or ten cent coins) on the gauze, this is normal. However, if there is persistent oozing or if the entire gauze becomes soaked with blood, apply pressure to stop the bleeding for 5–10 minutes. If the bleeding does not stop or if the wound shows signs of redness, swelling, heat, pain, or if your body temperature exceeds 38°C, please return to the clinic promptly.
