## Asthma Patient Precautions

## 1. Definition of Asthma:

Asthma is a bronchial inflammation that causes the airways to swell and increase mucus secretion, resulting in narrowed airways and symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath.

## 2. Causes:

1. Respiratory inflammation leading to swelling of the upper airway mucosa.

2. Narrowed airways causing breathing difficulties, which can be improved with treatment.

3. Hyperreactivity of the respiratory system (excessive sensitivity), so the airways react strongly to various stimuli such as tobacco smoke, smoke, pollen, cold air, etc. This heightened sensitivity easily triggers asthma attacks, resulting in chest tightness, coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath.

## 3. Main Symptoms of Asthma:

1. Shortness of breath.

2. Wheezing.

3. Chest tightness.

4. Chronic cough.

Not all asthma patients exhibit wheezing; some patients only experience coughing, especially during the night or after exercise. Treatment should be initiated even if symptoms are mild, as early intervention can prevent symptom progression and long-term lung damage.

## 4. Home Living Precautions:

1. Inhalation medication: Remember your doctor’s prescribed instructions regarding the usage method, dosage, and frequency of inhaled medications, and use them correctly and consistently.

2. Emergency inhaler usage (e.g., Berodual):

(1) Shake the inhaler bottle up and down thoroughly.

(2) Exhale completely, then place the inhaler mouthpiece about 5 cm into an open mouth. If the inhaler has a mouthpiece attachment, simply place it directly into your mouth.

(3) Press the inhaler button and inhale slowly.

(4) After inhaling fully, close your mouth tightly and count silently from one to ten.

(5) Exhale slowly, and repeat the inhalation after five minutes. Complete two inhalations to consider the procedure successful.

(6) If symptoms do not improve after 3–5 inhalations, seek medical attention immediately.

3. Regular medication use: Hospital treatment is just the beginning. Please strictly follow your doctor’s instructions and take prescribed medications (inhaled or oral) at regular intervals and in the prescribed doses. Before the medication runs out, visit the recommended outpatient clinic to continue treatment and ensure effective disease control.

4. If asthma is allergy-induced, avoid exposure to common allergens that trigger attacks, such as pollen, dust, carpets, pets, curtains, etc.

5. Wash hands frequently. Avoid placing dusty items (such as large bookshelves) in the bedroom.

6. Bed linens: Avoid using down-filled bedding; instead, use washable cotton covers and wash them weekly. Frequently wash sheets and pillowcases.

7. Avoid unhealthy dietary habits such as smoking, chewing betel nut, or drinking alcoholic beverages, as these can negatively affect your condition. Avoid places with heavy smoke (e.g., bars).

8. Avoid emotional fluctuations, stress, or sedative medications, as these may trigger asthma attacks.

9. When outdoor air pollution levels are high, close windows, turn on air conditioners, dehumidifiers, or air purifiers, and avoid going to poorly ventilated public places to prevent catching colds that may trigger asthma attacks.

10. Wear a mask and scarf when getting up in the morning or going out. Maintain a dry living environment with humidity between 60–70%.

11. Maintain appropriate and moderate physical activity. Perform warm-up exercises before exercising.
