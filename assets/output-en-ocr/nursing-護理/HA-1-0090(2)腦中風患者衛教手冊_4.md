Types of Stroke

Ischemic Stroke

## Causes:

1. Blockage of brain blood vessels leading to blood flow obstruction and impaired blood supply

## Non-cardiac

Due to atherosclerosis of the brain blood vessel walls, causing thickening of the vessel walls and formation of plaques, which gradually narrow the vessel lumen, resulting in:

★ Atherosclerotic cerebral infarction in large arteries: occurs due to blockage in major blood vessels  
★ Lacunar infarction: occurs due to blockage in small blood vessels

Usually associated with the "three highs" (high blood pressure, high blood lipids, high blood sugar)

## Cardiac

Caused by thrombi or plaques becoming lodged in brain blood vessels, leading to blockage:

Often results from thrombi originating in the heart, hence also known as cardiac embolic stroke. Usually associated with arrhythmia
