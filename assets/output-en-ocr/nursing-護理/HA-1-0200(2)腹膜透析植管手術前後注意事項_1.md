## Three. Pipeline Care and Precautions

## (1) Before Surgery

1. If you have constipation or have not had a bowel movement daily, please inform your doctor for evaluation.

Purpose: To reduce the risk of pipeline obstruction after catheter placement.

2. Prepare an abdominal binder (for abdominal surgery):

To be brought into the operating room with the patient on the day of surgery, for ease of use postoperatively.

Timing of binder use: From the day of surgery until 2 weeks postoperatively. The binder may be temporarily omitted if the patient is lying flat and not turning or moving.

## (2) After Surgery

1. The pipeline is enclosed within the abdominal binder.

2. Check the wound dressing for any signs of bleeding.

3. Disinfect the wound daily.

Within 24 hours after surgery: Encourage bed rest to reduce pulling on the wound, which may cause pain and bleeding.

After 24 hours post-surgery: When the patient's condition allows, get out of bed and move around to promote intestinal peristalsis.
