## Hemodialysis

##  $ ^{*} $ Introduction:

Hemodialysis, commonly known as "kidney dialysis," involves replacing kidney function through dialysis treatment after a physician confirms a diagnosis of renal failure. This treatment removes excess water and waste products from the body.

##  $ ^{*} $ Definition:

Hemodialysis uses dialysis fluid to enter an artificial kidney, where a synthetic semipermeable membrane exchanges uremic toxins with blood, thereby achieving the removal of waste products and excess fluid.

$ ^{*} $ Route:

Before hemodialysis, a well-established vascular access must be established—typically through a arteriovenous (AV) fistula. This surgical procedure involves connecting an artery and a vein in the arm via vascular surgery, forming a dialysis access. After surgery, stitches are removed approximately 7–10 days later, and the entire process takes over four weeks. Only after the access matures can dialysis begin.

*Post-operative care after arteriovenous fistula surgery:

1. Avoid treatments at the surgical site, such as intravenous infusion, blood pressure measurement, or blood drawing.

2. Do not hang heavy objects on the affected arm.

3. Do not scratch or damage the skin at the arteriovenous fistula site.

4. Prevent pressure on the surgical area (e.g., do not place the surgical arm under your head while sleeping).

5. It is recommended to start ball-handling exercises within 24 hours after surgery to promote maturation of the fistula.

6. Keep the wound dry; cover it with gauze for at least 24 hours before removing it. Apply povidone-iodine solution daily and cover with sterile gauze. When resting in bed, use a pillow to elevate the surgical arm to reduce swelling at the wound site.

7. Avoid bending the surgical arm for prolonged periods.
