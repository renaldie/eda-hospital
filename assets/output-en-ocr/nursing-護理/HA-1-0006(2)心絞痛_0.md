(Three) Daily Health Care: In terms of daily health care, the most important aspect is avoiding worries and maintaining a regular sleep routine. In addition, special attention should be paid to the following treatment principles:

1. For individuals with hypertension, diabetes, or elevated lipid levels, early intervention should be undertaken to prevent the occurrence of complications.

2. Maintain a healthy body weight to avoid excessive obesity.

3. Engage in moderate and regular physical activity—between 75 and 150 minutes per week. The ideal heart rate during exercise should be approximately 50% to 80% of (220 minus age). According to surveys, individuals who engage in moderate physical activity rarely experience heart disease episodes.

4. Smoking should be strictly avoided, as nicotine in tobacco causes blood vessel constriction and may lead to angina.

5. For those who have never consumed alcohol, continue to maintain zero alcohol intake. If you have a light drinking habit, limit alcohol consumption to no more than 14 grams per day (for example, a 330cc bottle of Taiwan beer with 4.5% alcohol content contains approximately 330 × 0.045 = 14.85 grams of alcohol).

6. Maintain a calm mood and try to minimize emotional excitement and stress.
