## Six. Daily Care Guidelines

1. For the first week after returning home, avoid intense physical activities or excessive flexion of the hip or knee joints, such as mountain climbing, rapid going up and down stairs, or lifting heavy objects.

2. Avoid overeating; instead, consume more vegetables and moderate amounts of fruits, and avoid straining during bowel movements.

3. If, after discharge, you experience pain, swelling, persistent bleeding, or bruising at the wound site, return to the hospital immediately for follow-up.

4. Take medications regularly. The primary function of these medications is to prevent re-occlusion or re-stenosis of blood vessels. If you experience any adverse effects from the medication, discuss it with your doctor and adjust the treatment accordingly—do not stop taking the medication on your own.

5. Attend regular follow-up appointments, as some patients may experience recurrent chest pain, which could indicate a re-occlusion of blood vessels. Such re-occlusion often occurs within the first six months after surgery.

1. What is the rate of re-occlusion after percutaneous coronary intervention?

After balloon angioplasty alone, the rate of restenosis reaches 30% to 40% within three to six months. Therefore, most patients receive stent placement following balloon angioplasty. After placing a conventional metal stent, the rate of restenosis within one year drops to 12% to 18%. With drug-coated stents, the rate of restenosis within one year decreases to 5–9%, approximately halving the risk of re-occlusion compared to conventional metal stents.
