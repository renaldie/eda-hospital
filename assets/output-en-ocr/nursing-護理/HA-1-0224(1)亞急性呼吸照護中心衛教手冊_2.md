## Visiting Principles

To effectively control infection, visiting times are limited, and the number of visitors is capped at two. Proper isolation precautions must be followed, including wearing isolation gowns, masks, and practicing hand hygiene to prevent cross-infection. If visits are delayed, the scheduled 30-minute visiting time will still be fulfilled.

## Thorough Handwashing to Prevent Infection

▶ Children under the age of 12 have weaker immune systems and are restricted from entering.  
▶ Visitors with contagious diseases are not allowed to enter. If you have respiratory symptoms, please wear a mask throughout the visit.  
▶ When entering the sub-acute respiratory care unit, please turn off your mobile phone, as patients have many tubes and devices that are susceptible to electromagnetic interference. Please also ensure that you and your family understand the purpose and importance of these tubes and devices, and do not move the patient without permission. Protective restraints may be applied if necessary.
