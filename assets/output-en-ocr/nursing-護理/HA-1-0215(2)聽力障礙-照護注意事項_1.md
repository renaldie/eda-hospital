## ➢ Hearing Loss Management and Care:

1. First, visit an otolaryngology outpatient clinic to identify the cause and receive further treatment.

2. Conduct hearing tests and assessments, and wear appropriate hearing aids, which can help improve quality of life.

(Various types of hearing aids are available based on the degree of hearing loss and lifestyle, such as behind-the-ear, in-the-ear, and pocket-style models)

3. Avoid prolonged exposure to noise and reduce long-term use of earphones.

4. During conversations, speak face-to-face, avoid shouting, use a lower volume, speak slowly and clearly.

5. Do not insert objects into the ears randomly. Earwax has protective functions and can prevent ear infections. If earwax impaction occurs, seek assistance from an otolaryngologist for removal.

## When hearing abnormalities are detected, seek medical examination as soon as possible to take advantage of the opportunity to correct hearing loss.
