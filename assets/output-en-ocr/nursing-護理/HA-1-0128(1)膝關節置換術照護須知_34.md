## IX. Walking Activities

1. On the first day after surgery: Encourage the patient to remain in a semi-sitting position (approximately 70°–90°) as much as possible to prevent orthostatic hypotension when getting up from bed. A gradual transition from bed to standing should be adopted: first raise the head of the bed, wait for 10 minutes without any discomfort, then sit at the edge of the bed for 5–10 minutes. If no dizziness or discomfort occurs, with assistance from others, stand using a walker. Only after confirming no dizziness during standing should the patient use the walker to walk within the ward.

2. From the second day after surgery onwards: The patient can walk using a walker along the hospital corridor, four times per day, each session lasting 5 minutes. After activity, the patient should rest in bed and elevate the affected limb while applying ice to reduce swelling.

3. The use of a walker should be maintained for at least 6–8 weeks to prevent excessive weight-bearing on the bone before it has fully healed.
