## I. The Impact of Pain

Pain is a subjective sensation of suffering, which may be continuous or intermittent, and may manifest as dull, sharp, or stabbing pain. Physiologically, patients may experience anxiety, insomnia, reduced appetite, tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and endocrine dysfunction. Pain may also slow down breathing (pain from upper abdominal or thoracic surgery worsens with respiration), lead to unwillingness to get out of bed and move, resulting in inadequate lung expansion, venous thrombosis, and other complications, thereby delaying discharge.

Only you can describe your pain. Be brave and tell your doctor or nurse about your pain concerns. With correct expression and assessment methods, 90% of pain can be effectively relieved.

You can do the following:

1. You can state where the pain is located, or point to the area with your hand.

2. Inform the medical or nursing staff when the pain first started, how often it occurs, and how long each episode lasts.

3. Clearly describe the sensation of the pain—for example, dull, sharp, or stabbing pain?

4. Inform the medical or nursing staff whether the pain has affected your daily routine—for example, inability to sleep.

5. Accurately express your pain score.  
We recommend using the "Pain Assessment Scale"
