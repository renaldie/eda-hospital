## Postoperative Care Instructions for Thyroid Radiofrequency Ablation (Ablation) Surgery

1. Rest for 30 minutes after surgery, then you can go home and resume normal eating. You can return to work normally the day after surgery.

2. The surgical wound will be covered with gauze or waterproof dressing. Avoid direct contact with water on the wound on the same day. After 24 hours, the gauze or dressing can be removed. Cover the wound with OK bandage and topical ointment until it heals. Healing time varies depending on individual constitution, but the wound typically heals within about one week.

3. Ice敷 should be applied on the day of surgery to reduce swelling and relieve symptoms. However, avoid frostbite.

4. Within one week after surgery, you may feel swelling in the neck, or even a slight increase in size. You may also feel discomfort when swallowing or turning your neck. These are normal phenomena and you should not be concerned. These sensations will gradually disappear. If pain occurs, take pain relievers as needed.

5. Avoid intense neck movements for one month after surgery. When you want to sneeze or cough, use your hands to protect your neck to prevent rupture and bleeding of the nodule.

6. Postoperative follow-up schedule: within two weeks, one month, three months, six months, and one year after surgery. After one year, return for check-up at least once a year. (Detailed information should be discussed with your treating physician.)

7. Ablation is not a traditional surgical resection; it involves allowing the nodule to gradually be absorbed. Typically, between one to three months after treatment, you will observe a gradual reduction in the size of the nodule.

8. Your doctor will evaluate the treatment response and discuss with you whether a second surgery may be necessary. Please note that ablation does not prevent cellular carcinogenesis. It is essential to attend regular follow-ups and inform your treating physician that you have undergone ablation to avoid misjudgment of your condition.

9. If you experience sudden swelling, redness of the skin, or bruising after surgery, apply ice and gently press on the affected area, and contact us or seek medical attention immediately.
