## One. Purpose of Plaster

The primary purpose of plaster is to provide support, protection, and immobilization at the site of a fracture after realignment or at the site of a joint disease following surgery, to promote healing and correct or prevent deformity.

## Two. Precautions After Plaster Application

1. The limb should be maintained in the prescribed position before the plaster dries (when the plaster appears gray).

2. Factors affecting plaster drying include: the amount of water to be evaporated in the plaster, the thickness of the plaster (number of layers of plaster bandage), and the surrounding environment (temperature, humidity, and ventilation).

3. For the first 24–48 hours after plaster application, elevate the affected limb above heart level to reduce swelling and promote drainage. Avoid placing any weight on the affected limb.

4. During the drying process, fresh plaster undergoes a crystallization reaction and releases "heat," so a feeling of warmth or heat for the first 15 minutes is normal.

## Three. Skin Care After Plaster Application

1. Daily bathing with water and soap is allowed if needed. Alcohol cotton balls can be used to dry fingers or toes, but care must be taken not to wet the plaster.

2. Develop a habit of regular, scheduled observation of skin condition: keep the skin clean and dry, apply lotion as needed, and provide appropriate warmth to the distal skin areas to promote blood circulation.

3. Do not insert objects into the plaster to scratch itchy skin underneath, as this may cause: (1) skin abrasion and infection underneath the plaster; (2) wrinkling of the padding beneath the plaster, leading to skin damage; (3) foreign objects falling into the plaster and being unable to be removed, resulting in skin compression and abrasion.

4. Daily checks should include monitoring of finger or toe movement and circulation, signs of swelling or inflammation, and the smell of the plaster (an acidic odor indicates sweating or peeling of the skin, which is normal and not abnormal).

5. Avoid pressure on the affected limb and protect skin at bony prominences. If skin breaks or exudates appear, notify the doctor immediately.

6. Perform rehabilitation exercises as instructed by the doctor to ensure adequate blood circulation to the distal extremities.

7. Maintain a balanced diet rich in sufficient calories, protein, vitamins B, C, D, and calcium to promote complete and rapid healing of the fracture site.
