## 【What is enteral nutrition?】

Some patients, due to illness, are unable to absorb nutrients through their mouth or gastrointestinal tract. In such cases, nutrients can be delivered directly into large blood vessels near the heart via a tube. This prevents inflammation in smaller peripheral blood vessels.

## 【Who needs home-based enteral nutrition?】

Sometimes patients no longer need hospitalization but are still unable to obtain nutrients through their mouth or nasogastric tube. With the assistance of medical and nursing teams, they can receive nutritional infusions at home.
