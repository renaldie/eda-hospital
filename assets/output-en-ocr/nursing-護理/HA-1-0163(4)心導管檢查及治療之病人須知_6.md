2. You will be conscious during the procedure. You may be asked to cough forcefully during the process to promote coronary artery blood flow.

3. During the injection of the contrast agent, you might feel sensations such as whole-body warmth, nausea, or vomiting. Please do not worry—these sensations will disappear quickly.

4. If you experience any discomfort such as chest tightness, chills, fever, palpitations, or shortness of breath during the procedure, please immediately inform the medical staff.

## (Three) After Catheterization:

1. If the examination site is the wrist, medical personnel will apply a pressure band or gauze with a wide adhesive ring around the puncture site. Gradually, part of the wide adhesive will be removed after 4 hours, and the entire band will be completely removed the next morning. A new dressing will be applied to prevent the waterproof film from peeling off. Avoid using the affected limb, and do not lift heavy objects for one week after the procedure.

2. If the examination site is the groin, and the catheter has already been removed in the examination room, medical staff will apply direct pressure with a pressure device for 30 minutes to stop bleeding. Then, a sandbag weighing approximately 2 kilograms will be placed on the puncture site for 4 hours. The puncture site should not be bent, and the sandbag should remain in place. After removing the sandbag, you must remain flat on your back for 4–6 hours without turning over to prevent bleeding. You may then adopt a semi-sitting position. If there is no wound bleeding, you may get up and move around after being checked by medical staff.

3. For femoral artery catheterization at the groin with the catheter not yet removed, you must lie flat before the catheter is withdrawn. After catheter removal, apply a sandbag for 4 hours and remain flat for 6 hours. You may move your buttocks left and right, but the joint of the affected limb must remain straight—do not bend or exert force. The ankle may move freely. After the procedure, you may adopt a semi-sitting position. If there is no wound bleeding, you may get up and move around after being checked by medical staff.

4. After returning to the room, you should rest completely in bed for 4 hours. Due to prolonged lying down, if you need to urinate, please use a commode or urinal. If you have not urinated after 6 hours, please inform the nursing staff. For patients with wounds at the groin area, nursing staff should assist with using a commode or diaper when defecating.

5. Try to minimize getting up and avoid straining during bowel movements within 24 hours. If you experience difficulty in defecation, please inform the medical staff immediately to prevent bleeding from the wound.

6. Nursing staff will continuously monitor your vital signs, blood circulation, and temperature of the upper or lower limbs.

7. If you experience any discomfort such as nausea, vomiting, palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, bleeding, coldness, paleness, numbness, pain, abnormal swelling, bruising, or wet and hot dressing with pain on the side of the examination limb, please inform the medical staff immediately.

8. After returning to the room, you may resume normal eating. If there are no special contraindications (e.g., liver or kidney disease), it is recommended to drink plenty of water to help eliminate the contrast agent.

9. The next morning after the examination, nursing staff will remove the dressing, disinfect the wound, and cover it with gauze and waterproof film. If there are no complications, you may bathe with water the following day, and the gauze can be removed the day after.

10. On the day after the examination, there may be minor bruising around the wound. Please inform the doctor for inspection. The bruising will gradually fade over two to three weeks.
