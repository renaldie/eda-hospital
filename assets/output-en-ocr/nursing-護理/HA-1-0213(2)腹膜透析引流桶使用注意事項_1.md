| Frequency | Method | Illustration |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| Daily | If the blue sticker on the bottom of the drainage bucket falls off: 1. Obtain a new blue sticker from the peritoneal dialysis room and reattach it. You can use transparent tape to secure it, making it less likely to fall off. 2. You may also attach other patterned stickers or write or draw with oil-based markers. | <img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_829_222_1145_428.jpg"> |
