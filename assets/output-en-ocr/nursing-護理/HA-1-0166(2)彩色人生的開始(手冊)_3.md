## Three. Dietary Guidance

## 1. Caloric and Protein Requirements

|  | Before Transplant | Early Post-Transplant (Acute Phase; First 3 Months After Transplant) | Stable Period |
|---|---|---|---|
| Calories | General patients: 30 kcal/kg; Obese patients: 25 kcal/kg | 30–35 kcal/kg | 30 kcal/kg |
| Protein | 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day | 1.5 g/kg/day | 1–1.2 g/kg/day |

**Obesity is defined as BMI > 24.**  
**BMI calculation formula: [Weight (kg) ÷ Height (m)²].**  
Example: Consuming 1.5 g of protein per kg per day (e.g., if body weight is 50 kg, then 75 grams of protein should be consumed daily, approximately 7–8 portions of protein-rich foods).  

1 portion of protein food (1 portion = 7 grams of protein)  
= 1 two-ounce portion of meat (chicken, duck, goose, pork, beef, lamb, or fish, about three finger-width in size)  
= 1 cup (190 ml) of soy milk  
= 1 egg or 2 egg whites  
= 1/2 box of young tofu or 2 traditional block tofu  
= 2 triangular oil tofu pieces  

## 2. Dietary Guidance During Early Post-Transplant and Stable Period  

## (1) Pre-Transplant Nutritional Assessment  

Nutritional screening and evaluation for malnutrition should be conducted promptly for patients scheduled for surgery or planned liver transplantation, to treat malnutrition preoperatively and thereby improve body protein status.  

(2) Early Post-Transplant (Acute Phase; First 3 Months After Transplant)  

Post-surgery, the risks of sarcopenic obesity and metabolic syndrome should be considered. Nutritional rehabilitation should aim to restore whole-body protein and muscle function as early and rapidly as possible. Therefore, during this stage, patients should consume a **high-protein diet** and obtain **sufficient calories**.  

## Dietary Principle One  

a. Adequate protein intake (1.5 g/kg) and caloric intake.  

b. Avoid consuming grapefruit (juice) or pomelos (and related products) one hour before or after taking immunosuppressants. Grapefruit may cause severe side effects such as muscle spasms and loss of consciousness; pomelos may interfere with drug absorption.  

c. Pay attention to food safety and hygiene, avoid consuming raw foods (such as raw salad, raw fish, raw eggs, raw oysters, raw meat, and unsterilized fresh milk), ensure all food is thoroughly cooked and boiled before consumption, avoid eating leftovers, and ensure utensils are cleaned and disinfected before use.  

d. Choose fruits with skin and remove the outer skin, or boil fruits before consumption.  

e. Avoid consuming supplements and immune-boosting foods (such as human ginseng, ginkgo biloba, seaweed, etc.) to prevent triggering rejection reactions.  

f. For patients with hyperglycemia (due to steroid or immunosuppressant use), control starch intake appropriately and avoid refined sugars (fructose, sucrose, etc.). Replace staple foods with non-refined starches such as whole grains or root and tuber vegetables (pumpkin, sweet potato, brown rice, etc.).  

g. For patients with hyperkalemia (due to immunosuppression), reduce intake of high-potassium foods (bananas, watermelon, vegetable juice, meat broth, traditional Chinese medicine soups, energy drinks, monosodium glutamate, etc.). Alternatively, blanch vegetables (2–3 minutes) before stir-frying or mixing with oil.  

(3) Stable Period  

Maintain the function of the transplanted organ through proper nutrition, reduce metabolic complications caused by long-term immunosuppressive drug use, and improve quality of life. Maintain good nutritional status to prevent nutrient deficiencies and reduce the occurrence of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and obesity.
