## Three. Precautions for Home Care

1. Continue performing rehabilitation exercises taught in the hospital every day after returning home.

2. Keep wounds as dry as possible. If redness, swelling, or abnormal exudate occurs, seek medical evaluation promptly.

3. Avoid rubbing or bumping the wound and intense physical activities (such as running or jumping). Adhere to the activity restrictions instructed by your doctor.

4. Use a walking aid for 6–8 weeks post-surgery until your doctor, during follow-up visits, deems it safe to resume normal activities. Take precautions to prevent falls.

5. After prolonged periods of standing or getting up from bed, blood circulation in the affected limb may be slower, leading to swelling in the feet. Therefore, elevate the affected limb and apply ice after getting up to help reduce swelling.

6. The following activities must be approved by your doctor before being performed: driving, half-squatting, lifting heavy objects (over 3 kilograms), long-distance walking, or hiking.

7. When passing through security checkpoints, the machine may alert you that metal items are carried. You may explain the situation to the security officer or provide a hospital surgical certificate.

8. Metal implants, both internal and external (such as artificial joints), prohibit deep heat therapy (e.g., shortwave diathermy), as excessive heat concentration may cause burns.

9. When a patient has a cold or infection in another area or requires dental treatment, proactively inform your doctor about the presence of an artificial joint so that the doctor can assess appropriate medication guidelines.
