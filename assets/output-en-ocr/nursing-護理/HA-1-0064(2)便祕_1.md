## Constipation

## 1. What is constipation:

Difficulty in passing dry, small amounts (less than 50 grams per day) or infrequent bowel movements  
(frequently occurring once every three days).

## 2. Causes of constipation include the following:

1. Insufficient fluid intake.  
2. Inadequate dietary fiber consumption.  
3. Lack of physical activity.  
4. Depression, life stress, tension, and a busy schedule, which suppress gastrointestinal function and cause intestinal muscle tension.  
5. Anorectal diseases (such as anal fissures, anal abscesses, or anal stenosis).  
6. Drug effects.  
7. Pregnancy.  
8. Mechanical obstruction: tumors.  
9. Systemic diseases: diabetes, stroke.

## 3. Symptoms of constipation include the following:

1. Infrequent bowel movements and difficulty in defecation.  
2. Needing to strain during bowel movements.  
3. Pain or rectal bleeding during defecation.  
4. Persistent sensation of needing to defecate after bowel movements.  
5. Abdominal bloating and pain.  
6. Passing only small amounts of loose stool or leakage—this is a late-stage symptom of severe constipation.

## 4. Prevention and health tips for constipation include the following:

1. Drink more water, fruit juice, or milk to increase body fluid and facilitate the passage of dry feces.  
2. Eat more foods rich in fiber or vitamins.  
3. Chew food slowly and thoroughly, and add digestive aids to your meals.  
4. Limit consumption of caffeinated, alcoholic, or carbonated beverages to prevent dehydration.  
5. Avoid refined or processed foods.  
6. Eat small, frequent meals to maintain energy levels between meals and support healthy digestive function.  
7. Ensure adequate sleep and rest, and avoid lifestyle stress that may affect health or lead to digestive disorders.  
8. Maintain regular physical activity to improve blood circulation and support digestive function.  
9. Develop a habit of regular bowel movements—ideally within one hour after breakfast. Do not rush; even if no stool is passed, sit quietly for ten minutes to focus on it.  
10. Avoid stress and anxiety; drinking warm water can promote intestinal motility. Avoid using laxatives.  
11. If there is no significant improvement, consider the possibility of mechanical obstruction caused by tumors.
