## Three. Precautions for Home Care

1. Continue performing rehabilitation exercises taught in the hospital every day after returning home.

2. Keep wounds as dry as possible. If redness, swelling, or abnormal exudate occurs, seek medical evaluation promptly.

3. Avoid rubbing or bumping the wound and intense physical activities (such as running or jumping). Adhere to the activity restrictions instructed by your doctor.

4. Use a walking aid for 6–8 weeks post-surgery until your doctor, during follow-up visits, deems it safe to resume normal activities. Take precautions to prevent falls.

5. After prolonged periods of standing or getting up from bed, the blood flow back to the extremities of the affected limb may be slower, leading to swelling in the feet. Therefore, elevate the affected limb and apply ice after getting up to help reduce swelling.

6. The following activities must be approved by your doctor before being performed: driving, half-squatting, lifting heavy objects (over 3 kilograms), long-distance walking, or hiking.

7. When passing through security checkpoints, the machine may alert you that you are carrying metal. You can explain the situation to the security officer or provide your hospital surgical certificate.

8. For both internal and external metallic implants such as artificial joints, deep heat therapy (e.g., shortwave diathermy) is strictly prohibited, as excessive heat concentration may cause burns.

9. When a patient has a cold or infection in another area or requires dental treatment, proactively inform your doctor about the presence of a joint replacement so that the doctor can appropriately assess medication guidelines.
