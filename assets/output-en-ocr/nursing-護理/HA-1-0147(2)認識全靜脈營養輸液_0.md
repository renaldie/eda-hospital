## What precautions should be taken during total parenteral nutrition (TPN) therapy?

1. Infusion will be administered over 24 hours, using a drip pump to control the rate. If you notice any bleeding, moisture, loose tubing, or redness, warmth, or discomfort at the injection site, please inform the medical staff immediately.

2. During the treatment period, blood glucose levels, nutritional status, and blood electrolyte concentrations will be monitored.

3. The physician will assess when it is safe to start eating, and you will need to record your intake and output. The physician will determine when to discontinue the parenteral nutrition infusion.
