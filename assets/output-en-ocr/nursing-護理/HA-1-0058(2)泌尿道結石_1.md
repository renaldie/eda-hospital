## Urological Stones

## I. Causes of ureteral stones:

High concentrations of various free ions in urine lead to crystal aggregation and stone formation.

## II. Symptoms of urological stones:

1. Dull pain in the back or renal colic, which may radiate to the testicles (in males) or bladder (in females).

2. Infection: chills or fever.

3. Hematuria, urgency, and difficulty in urination.

4. Possible obstruction leading to renal edema, urinary retention, and impaired renal function.

## III. Treatment of urological stones: Treatment options must be evaluated by a physician

1. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL).

2. Endoscopic stone removal is preferred.

3. Percutaneous nephrostomy surgery.

## IV. Prevention of urological stones:

1. Drink plenty of water to dilute urine; it is recommended to consume 2000–3000 mL of water daily. This helps flush out urinary stones through its flushing effect.

2. Maintain a balanced diet and reduce intake of calcium, phosphorus, oxalates, and high-pyridine foods (see Table 1).

Table 1:

| Foods High in Calcium and Phosphorus | Milk, cheese, clams, shrimp, raisins, cereal |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Oxalate-rich foods                  | Spinach, tomatoes, cocoa, plums, almonds, beans |
| High-pyridine foods                | Animal offal, sardines, legumes            |

3. Urinate naturally and avoid holding urine.

4. Seek early treatment if urine color darkens or urination becomes difficult.

5. Engage in appropriate leisure activities.
