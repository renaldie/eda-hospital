## Long-term living and rehabilitation after stroke

After neurological function and vital signs have stabilized, rehabilitation plans are actively arranged based on the extent of impairment in motor and cognitive functions. The primary goal of this stage is to enhance self-care abilities, so that patients can live as independently as possible upon returning home and reduce their dependence on caregivers.

## Rehabilitation begins during hospitalization

During the acute phase, joint mobilization is the main focus. Once the patient's condition stabilizes, exercises such as turning over, sitting up, repositioning, and using assistive devices can be introduced, followed by learning to walk and hand function to achieve the goal of daily living independence. Patients need to continue rehabilitation after discharge to achieve the best possible functional recovery.
