## What is Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

## 1. Definition

It refers to a chronic, long-term respiratory disease that cannot be fully recovered from, causing difficulty in the smooth flow of air in and out of the respiratory tract. It typically includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema.

## 2. Causes

Smoking, air pollution, infections, allergies, genetic factors, and aging of the lungs.

## 3. Examination

1. Physical examination.  
2. Chest X-ray.  
3. Pulmonary function test.  
4. Arterial blood gas analysis.  
5. Sputum examination.  
6. Chest CT scan.

## Symptoms

1. Chronic bronchitis  
- Red or cyanotic complexion  
- Weight gain  
- Coughing commonly occurring in the morning  
- Lasting for two years or more, with at least three months of symptoms annually  

2. Emphysema  
- Rosy complexion  
- Weight loss  
- Jugular venous distension during exhalation  
- Prolonged exhalation

## Treatment

1. Quit smoking  
2. Medication therapy  
3. Dietary therapy  
4. Home oxygen therapy  
5. Respiratory exercises

## 6. Nursing Guidance

### 1. Medication Awareness

Doctors will adjust medication dosage based on symptoms. Therefore, patients must never self-adjust medication dosage. Doing so will not help their condition and may cause significant discomfort.

### 2. Dietary Guidelines

A proper nutritional status can reduce respiratory effort and enhance the body's resistance. The following dietary principles are recommended for reference:

(1) Choose simple, varied, and easy-to-prepare foods such as stir-fried noodles or salty porridge.  
(2) Eat small meals frequently; avoid overeating. Take a rest before meals and do not lie down immediately after eating.  
(3) In terms of energy provision, increase unsaturated fats such as soybean oil, which can provide sufficient energy while reducing respiratory burden.  
(4) Consume adequate fruits and vegetables to develop regular bowel habits and prevent constipation, which may obstruct breathing.  
(5) Follow the doctor’s advice on fluid and salt intake, and thus avoid preserved foods, pickled vegetables, and canned foods.  
(6) Avoid foods that cause gas, such as beans, radishes, cauliflower, onions, corn, and cabbage.  
(7) Chew food slowly and thoroughly. If breathing difficulties occur during eating, pause and rest until breathing stabilizes before continuing to eat, or follow the doctor’s instructions to use oxygen.  
(8) For any other dietary concerns, consult the doctor, nurse, or nutritionist.

### 3. Home Oxygen Therapy Guidelines

Patients who require home oxygen therapy should first understand and strictly follow the following points:

(1) Be familiar with signs of hypoxia, such as dizziness, headache, drowsiness, shortness of breath, tachycardia, and cyanosis.  
(2) Smoking, using lighters, or any fire sources are strictly prohibited in the room where oxygen is being used or stored.  

(3) Oxygen storage containers should not be placed near heat sources or electrical appliances (such as heaters, heat exchangers, TVs, electric shavers, etc.).  
(4) Secure the oxygen storage container to prevent tipping.  
(5) Place the oxygen storage container in a well-ventilated area and avoid enclosed spaces with poor ventilation (such as car cabins or cabinets).  
(6) No lubricants should be applied to oxygen equipment.

### 4. Respiratory Exercise Guidelines

(1) Wear loose clothing and perform exercises in a comfortable environment.  
(2) Exercises should be performed before meals to avoid gastric contents obstructing lung expansion.  
(3) Start with the lowest intensity, duration, and frequency, and gradually increase over time.  
(4) For patients using oxygen, adjust the oxygen flow rate to the most suitable level as prescribed by the doctor during exercise.  
(5) If dizziness, shortness of breath, tachycardia, or cyanosis occurs during exercise, stop immediately.

### 5. Daily Home Life Care

In addition to the above treatments, patients should maintain a good home environment and adopt energy-saving practices for daily care to achieve a high quality of life.

## (1) Prevent Infection

$ ^{*} $ Avoid crowded public places and avoid contact with people who have colds.  
$ ^{*} $ Maintain good nutrition and sufficient sleep to enhance resistance.  
$ ^{*} $ Dress appropriately to avoid catching colds.  
$ ^{*} $ Recognize the signs of infection. If there is an increase in sputum volume, yellow or thick sputum, fever, worsening cough, or increased shortness of breath, seek medical attention promptly.
