Unable to speak, eat, open eyes, or focus when conversing with others; appears drowsy and gradually enters an unconscious state.

## Care Preparation:

$ ^{*} $ At this stage, assist the patient with turning or massage, but avoid forcing the patient to get up or waking them up.

## (3) The Gurgling Sound Near Death (loud sounds during breathing):

1. **Breathing**: May involve mouth breathing, with irregular speed and depth—sometimes rapid, sometimes slow, occasionally stopping for several seconds. It may resemble sighing, then becoming forceful before weakening, and occurring intermittently.

2. This sound is caused by secretions in the mouth that the patient cannot cough out due to weakness, or by increased secretions in the lungs, which may be mistakenly believed to indicate excessive phlegm.

## Care Preparation:

$ ^{*} $ Try elevating the head or positioning the patient on their side to change posture and alleviate symptoms.

$ ^{*} $ Use cotton swabs to remove oral secretions.

$ ^{*} $ Apply cool, moist steam to thin secretions, making them easier to expel.

$ ^{*} $ This is a significant sign near the end of life. At this stage, according to local customs, end-of-life preparations may be made.

## (4) Pulse:

Weaker, faster, or irregular; sometimes present and sometimes absent; the pulse may not be detectable when pressure is applied.

## (5) Vision:

Vision gradually blurs, eyes become dull and unfocused, gaze fixed forward, eyes cannot fully close during sleep, eyes drooping downward, and conjunctival edema (known as "lychee eyes").

## (6) Hearing:

Hearing is the last sense to fade. The patient may still perceive surrounding sounds, but is unable to respond or react.

## Care Preparation:

* When family or friends visit, hold the patient's hand, sit beside them, and introduce yourself, expressing gratitude and offering comfort to help the patient feel at ease. Avoid pulling on the patient or asking them to respond.

* Avoid loud noises; instead, play the patient's preferred soft or religious music.

## (7) Taste:

1. Dry mouth, bitter taste, altered taste, increased sensitivity, difficulty swallowing, burning sensation at the back of the tongue, increased tongue coating, angular cheilitis, and dry, cracked lips.

2. Due to the gradual decline in organ function, the patient may experience reduced appetite or complete loss of appetite. Additionally, due to diminished swallowing ability, refusal to eat may occur.
