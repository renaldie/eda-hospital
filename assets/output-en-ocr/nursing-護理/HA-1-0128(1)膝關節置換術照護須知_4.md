## I. Understanding Total Knee Arthroplasty

## 1. Introduction

When the knee joint degenerates, patients may experience pain, swelling, deformity, and weakness in the affected limb. In severe cases, this can lead to difficulty walking. Initial outpatient management typically involves medication and physical therapy. If pain or deformity persists despite medication and rehabilitation, and if walking becomes difficult, total knee arthroplasty may be required.
