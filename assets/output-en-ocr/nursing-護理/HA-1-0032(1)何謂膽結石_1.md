## What are gallstones?

## I. Introduction:

Gallstones are a common condition and can become a significant health concern.

## II. Classification:

The exact cause of gallstone formation remains unclear. Common types of gallstones can be divided into two categories: pigment stones (pigment stones) and cholesterol stones (cholesterol stones). In Taiwan, most gallstones are pigment stones, accounting for over 60%.

## III. Causes of cholesterol gallstones:

1. Genetics: The incidence varies among different ethnic groups. For example, up to 80% of adult Peruvian Indian women may have cholesterol gallstones, significantly higher than in Eastern populations.

2. Gender: Women after the age of adulthood have a higher incidence than men of the same age group.

3. Age: The incidence increases with age.

4. Pregnancy: During pregnancy, the saturation of bile increases, along with the physiological effects of female hormones, making gallstone formation more likely.

5. Medications: Long-term use of oral contraceptives and postmenopausal hormone therapy significantly increases the risk of gallstone formation.

6. Obesity: Obese patients have higher cholesterol concentrations and increased cholesterol synthesis in bile, making them more prone to gallstone formation.

7. Diabetes: Diabetic patients are more likely to develop gallstones, often due to excessive cholesterol secretion and impaired gallbladder motility.

8. Pancreatic disease: This results from poor digestion and absorption of bile salts.

9. Post-gastrointestinal surgery: Certain congenital malabsorption disorders or inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease, may lead to impaired bile salt reabsorption after surgical resection, increasing the risk of gallstone formation.

10. Dietary habits: Diets high in calories and fatty foods are more likely to cause cholesterol gallstones.

## IV. Complications:

Obstruction of the cystic duct may lead to biliary colic, acute cholecystitis, cholangitis, gallbladder rupture, peritonitis, sepsis, and intestinal obstruction due to gallstones. Biliary obstructive jaundice, cholangitis, cholelithiasis-induced pancreatitis, biliary stricture, and sepsis may also occur. There is also some suggestion that chronic cholecystitis may increase the risk of developing cholecyst cancer.

## V. Diagnosis:

In addition to clinical symptoms, abdominal ultrasound is the most convenient and highly accurate (over 95%) diagnostic tool. Depending on the situation,
