## Three. Dietary Guidance

1. After returning to the ward post-surgery, if there are no symptoms of dizziness or vomiting, adopt a progressive dietary approach: first try drinking a small amount of plain water. If no vomiting occurs, after one hour, you may consume liquid foods (such as fruit juice), then gradually transition to soft and easily digestible foods (such as porridge), and by the next day, you can return to normal eating. This progressive diet helps prevent digestive discomfort caused by slowed intestinal peristalsis due to anesthesia.

2. Eat more vitamin C-rich fruits such as kiwi, cherries, and grapes, as well as high-protein foods such as chicken, duck, fish, and beef, to promote wound healing. Also, consume high-fiber foods such as green vegetables to prevent constipation.

3. Remember to eat in a semi-reclining or sitting position, as eating while lying down increases the risk of aspiration and subsequent aspiration pneumonia.
