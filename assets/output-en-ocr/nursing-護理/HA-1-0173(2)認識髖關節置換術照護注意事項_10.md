## IV. Medication Use Throughout the Surgical Period

## (I) Prophylactic Antibiotics

1. Surgical prophylactic antibiotics refer to the administration of antibiotics to patients before surgery, prior to wound contamination or infection, in order to prevent postoperative infections.

2. Possible side effects such as allergies or gastrointestinal discomfort—such as skin rash, itching, or diarrhea—should be reported immediately to the medical team if they occur.

## (II) Antithrombotic Medications

1. To prevent the development of deep vein thrombosis, the physician will assess the patient's condition and decide whether to prescribe antithrombotic medications (such as anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents) after surgery.

2. If you have a history of gastrointestinal bleeding or peptic ulcers, please inform the medical team in advance.

3. During medication use, if you are scheduled to undergo any surgical procedures, tooth extraction, endoscopy, or other procedures that may cause bleeding, please inform your doctor in advance about your current use of these medications.

4. While taking antithrombotic medications, be cautious during daily activities to avoid injury. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and an electric razor when brushing teeth or shaving.

5. Possible side effects include gastrointestinal discomfort or bleeding reactions (such as hematoma at the surgical site, gingival bleeding, unexplained bruising, hematuria, melena, or black stools). If any bleeding symptoms occur, please visit the clinic immediately and inform the medical team.

6. If you have been receiving antithrombotic therapy prior to joint replacement surgery and have already discontinued the medication before surgery after discussion with your original prescribing physician, please discuss with your surgical physician regarding the timing of restarting antithrombotic therapy after surgery.

## VI. Pain Management

## I. The Impact of Pain

Pain is a subjective sensation of suffering, which may be continuous or intermittent, and may manifest as dull, sharp, or stabbing pain. Physiologically, patients may experience anxiety, insomnia, reduced appetite, tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and endocrine dysfunction. Pain may also reduce respiratory rate (especially in upper abdominal or thoracic surgeries, where pain intensifies with breathing), lead to reluctance to get out of bed and thus cause inadequate lung expansion, increasing the risk of venous thromboembolism and other complications, ultimately delaying discharge.

Only you can describe your pain. Be brave and tell your doctor or nurse about your pain concerns. With correct expression and assessment methods, 90% of pain can be effectively relieved.

## What You Can Do:

1. You can describe the location of your pain or point to the area with your hand.

2. Inform the medical staff when your pain first started, how often it occurs, and how long each episode lasts.

3. Clearly describe the sensation of your pain—for example, dull, sharp, or stabbing pain?

4. Inform the medical team whether your pain has affected your daily routine—for example, inability to sleep.

5. Express your pain score accurately. We recommend using a "Pain Assessment Scale" to describe your pain: 0 points means no pain, and 10 points represents unbearable pain.
