## Care Preparation:

$ ^{*} $ Maintain oral hygiene to prevent oral inflammation; use lip balm or petroleum jelly to keep lips moisturized.

$ ^{*} $ Wet the toothbrush with water to moisten the lips and increase humidity.

$ ^{*} $ Do not force patients to eat; offer only what they request.

* There is no need to worry about patients going hungry! The body knows its limits—when nutrients are no longer needed, appetite naturally diminishes and eating becomes difficult.

$ ^{*} $ If a patient is unable or unwilling to eat, do not force them to eat, as this may increase their distress.

## (8) Swallowing Difficulties:

Reduced intake of water and food during the end-of-life stage helps patients adjust to the dying process.

## Care Preparation:

* When patients lose the ability to swallow, moisten the oral cavity with a cotton swab dipped in warm water, or apply lip balm to the lips to increase moisture.

## (9) Elimination:

Constipation, incontinence of urine or feces, decreasing urine output, darkening of urine color, or urinary retention may occur.

## Care Preparation:

$ ^{*}$ Use diapers to maintain patient comfort and clean them regularly, but obtain the patient’s consent first.

* Prevent odor: pay attention to body hygiene, especially in the urinary organs, skin folds, and wounds. Place aromatic essential oils, coffee grounds, or tea渣 beside the bed.

## (10) Skin:

1. Due to severe weakness and inability to absorb nutrients, the skin and muscles throughout the body may become dull, lack luster, soft, and lose elasticity, or show symptoms such as night sweats, bruising, edema, and cold extremities.

2. Due to slow blood circulation, patients may experience elevated body temperature, cold hands and feet, and dark or purple nails or lips. These symptoms generally do not cause discomfort to the patient.

## Care Preparation:

$ ^{*} $ If a patient is sweating excessively or has a fever, help them take a bath, change into clean clothes, and discuss the use of antipyretics with a doctor.

$ ^{*} $ Keep clothes and bed linens smooth to prevent pressure sores.

$ ^{*} $ Use a neutral lotion to maintain smooth and even skin, prevent skin cracking and pressure sores. Gently massage the skin and move joints to reduce discomfort caused by skin breakdown, pressure sores, and muscle spasms.
