## Caution for Increased Intracranial Pressure

## I. Purpose

To prevent neurosurgical patients from experiencing increased intracranial pressure due to intracranial diseases, and to educate patients on how to observe and prevent increased intracranial pressure after discharge. This enables early detection of problems, control of brain pressure, and prevention of complications.

## II. Causes of Increased Intracranial Pressure

(1) Intracranial diseases: intracranial hemorrhage, hematoma, tumor.

(2) Cerebral edema: intracranial hemorrhage and hematoma caused by head trauma; malignant brain tumors; cerebrovascular diseases; after craniotomy.

(3) Improper cerebrospinal fluid drainage: congenital obstruction of the cerebral aqueduct, compression of the ventricles, reduced rate of cerebrospinal fluid absorption, excessive cerebrospinal fluid secretion.

(4) Bacterial or viral infections: encephalitis, meningitis, brain abscess.

## III. Factors that May Trigger Increased Intracranial Pressure

* Increased intrathoracic pressure: e.g., coughing

$ ^{*} $ Increased intra-abdominal pressure: e.g., straining during defecation

* Changes in posture: e.g., higher intracranial pressure when lying flat, improper head positioning affecting cerebral blood flow

$ ^{*} $ Environmental stimuli: e.g., bright light, loud noise, which may trigger increased intracranial pressure.
