## Before Eating

Start with more viscous foods, then proceed to solid foods.

Liquid foods should only be consumed after confirming they will not cause choking.

It is recommended to appropriately use thickening agents.

## During Eating

Food should be placed into the mouth from the healthier side.

Use a spoon that fits the size of the mouth, and eat at a moderate pace without being too rapid.
