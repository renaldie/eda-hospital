## Five. Postoperative Precautions:

1. Measure urine output every hour within the first 24 hours after surgery, and then at least every 8 hours thereafter.

2. Initially, check every 4 hours for leakage from the catheter bag and for skin irritation below the catheter bag. After six checks at 4-hour intervals, switch to checking every 8 hours.

3. Inspect the catheter site every hour during the first 24 hours after surgery. If no abnormalities are found, extend the interval to every 4 hours, and then to every 8 hours.

4. Record the size, shape, and color of the catheter opening. A normal catheter opening is pink or red. If the opening becomes darker or bluish, it may indicate inadequate blood supply and the beginning of necrosis.

5. Monitor for signs of peritonitis, such as abdominal pain or fever. Leakage from the anastomotic site or separation of the ureter from the catheter can lead to urine entering the peritoneal cavity.

## Six. Prognosis:

The prognosis of bladder cancer is closely related to the stage of the disease. In general, early-stage (Stage 0 and Stage I) cancers treated with electrocautery or urethral resection have a very good prognosis, although recurrence is common—recurrence is a characteristic feature of bladder cancer. The prognosis worsens significantly in stages two and beyond, with a five-year survival rate of only about 20%. Early diagnosis is therefore crucial for determining the prognosis of bladder cancer.

## Seven. Post-Discharge Instructions:

1. Avoid foods containing preservatives and chemicals. Foods that may contain pesticides should be thoroughly washed.

2. Drink plenty of water daily, maintaining a urine volume of over 2000 cc to reduce the concentration of carcinogens in the bladder.

3. Avoid developing the habit of holding urine.

4. Take large amounts of vitamins A, C, and B6 daily to acidify urine and reduce urinary tract infections.

5. Do not smoke.

6. Minimize hair dyeing and exposure to dyes and organic solvents.
