## 【Three: What should be paid attention to when receiving nutritional infusion at home?】

(1) Select family members or patients to receive care training. Training items include:

1. How to change the catheter? What is the drip rate?

2. How to measure blood glucose.

3. Record the amount of infusion administered, food intake, bowel movements, urine output, and bring the records to the hospital for reference during weekly outpatient visits.

4. Monitor for redness, swelling, or leakage at the injection site; change the catheter daily.

5. Prevention and observation of complications: check for fever, redness, swelling, heat, pain at the injection site, sweating, dizziness, or discomfort.

6. How to collect medication and attend follow-up appointments.

7. Who to contact when problems arise?

(2) Prepare a refrigerator for storing the nutritional infusion and the necessary disinfection supplies.

(3) Before each infusion, wash hands thoroughly with soap or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

(4) Coordinate the infusion schedule with family members' availability. In hospitals, infusions typically run for 24 hours. However, if the patient has sufficient physical strength to move around, discuss with the medical team to adjust the infusion duration to 16–20 hours. This allows patients to engage in activities such as bathing or walking during the non-infusion periods.

(5) Take body temperature daily.

(6) Weigh the patient weekly during outpatient visits.

(7) During weekly outpatient visits, go to the chemotherapy room to change the injection needle or disinfect the injection site.
