## Admission Guidelines for the Subacute Respiratory Care Center

## 1. Treatment Plan Explanation

After admission, the attending physician will assess the patient and initiate respiratory training and weaning from the ventilator program.

## 2. Treatment Outcomes and Follow-up Arrangements

1. If the patient successfully completes respiratory training and is weaned off the ventilator, they will be observed for 5 days and then transferred to a general ward for continued care.

2. If it is assessed that the patient cannot be weaned off the ventilator in the short term, discussions will be held with family members regarding transfer to the Chronic Respiratory Care Ward (RCW) or home care arrangements. The hospital's Discharge Preparation Service Team will assist with the development of follow-up care plans and referrals.

## 3. Special Situations During Hospitalization

If the patient's condition is unstable or requires surgical intervention, the physician may arrange for the patient to be returned to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for further treatment, depending on the situation.

## 4. Application for Major Illness

Patients who have used a ventilator for more than 21 consecutive days may apply for major illness status due to respiratory failure with continuous ventilator use exceeding 21 days (the hospital can handle this application during the hospital stay). The application review period is approximately 7 to 14 days (the review body is the Central Health Insurance Bureau, not the thoracic surgery physicians at this hospital).
