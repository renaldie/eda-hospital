## Think of Flavor, Combine with Care

## Daily Life Care

1. Turn the patient every 2~3 hours.

2. Perform passive joint exercises at appropriate times.

3. Keep the skin clean and dry; alternatively, use a foam mattress to prevent pressure sores.

4. Pay attention to maintaining airway patency. Encourage the patient to take deep breaths and cough, or have family members assist with back percussion.

5. Suggest adopting a sitting position more often, which can expand lung capacity.

The patient's bed should have protective devices such as bed rails or bed guards. Protective restraints may be provided if necessary to prevent falls or accidental dislodgement of tubes.
