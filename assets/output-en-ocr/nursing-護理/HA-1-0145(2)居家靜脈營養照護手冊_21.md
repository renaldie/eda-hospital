Between the time of prescription issuance, go to the pricing counter to settle the bill. Approximately 2–3 hours later, please go to the pharmacy on the first floor to collect the lipid emulsion and the medication consultation room to collect the total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solution. Also, collect the related medical supplies at the first-floor injection room (light-protected tubing, regular tubing, three-way piston, 5 cc syringe caps, and 10 cc syringe caps). During the journey home, the total parenteral nutrition solution must be kept cold using an ice bucket. Once home, store it in the refrigerator, where it can be kept for up to 7 days.

### 2. Collection of Peripheral Parenteral Nutrition

Visit your original treating physician's outpatient clinic for a follow-up visit. The physician and the specialized peripheral venous nutrition nurse will assess your home-based peripheral venous nutrition usage. The physician will determine the frequency of outpatient follow-ups based on the situation and issue a prescription. After receiving the prescription, go to the pricing counter to settle the bill. Collect the peripheral parenteral nutrition solution at the pharmacy on the first floor. Also, collect the required medical supplies (regular tubing, syringe caps, and 10 cc syringe caps) at the first-floor injection room. After returning home, store the solution at room temperature and avoid exposure to direct sunlight.

## [12. Daily Living Care]

## (1) Bathing:

Bathing can be done during times when no parenteral nutrition injections are being administered. If it is unavoidable and the injection site gets wet, there is no need to worry, as the sterile transparent dressing (OP SITE) is waterproof. If water does enter the injection site, simply re-disinfect and change the dressing.

## (2) Activities:

Try to administer injections at night, allowing daytime activities such as going out or attending school. Older children can be trained to take on some responsibility for their care. Family members should treat the situation with normalcy and avoid excessive concern.
