## Appendectomy and Postoperative Precautions

## I. Causes:

The appendix is a part of the cecum and has no physiological function in adults. Once inflammation occurs and leads to rupture, it may cause serious complications such as peritonitis. Typical symptoms include pain around the navel or upper abdomen, followed by loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. The pain then gradually shifts to the lower right abdomen, and finally fever develops.

## II. Treatment Methods:

Most cases are treated surgically. There are two types of surgical procedures: traditional appendectomy and laparoscopic appendectomy. The latter has a faster recovery and less postoperative pain.

## III. Postoperative Precautions:

1. On the day of surgery, do not consume food or fluids. Medical staff will inform you when it is safe to eat based on your condition. During the fasting period, intravenous fluids will be administered to meet your physiological needs.

2. After returning to the ward, if you do not experience dizziness or weakness, encourage early ambulation to promote intestinal motility and early bowel movement. When getting up for the first time, proceed gradually (start by raising the bed head -> sit on the edge of the bed -> stand up), and have a family member accompany you to prevent falls.

3. You may adopt a semi-reclining position to relax abdominal muscles and reduce pain at the incision site.

4. When medical staff inform you that you may start eating, first drink a small amount of warm water. If there is no abdominal distension or vomiting, you may begin with soft foods (such as porridge or steamed egg), gradually returning to a normal diet.

5. Avoid eating overly sweet foods and gas-producing foods such as milk and dairy products, as these may cause abdominal distension and discomfort.

6. When coughing, gently press the incision site with your palm or pillow, or use an abdominal binder to reduce pain and discomfort caused by abdominal tension.

7. If the incision pain is unbearable, please inform the nursing staff. We will administer pain relief medication as prescribed to avoid enduring pain and ensuring adequate rest and recovery.

8. If you have a drainage tube in place, please monitor the tube carefully and avoid pulling or tugging on it. Pay attention to the color and volume of the drainage fluid. If you notice any abnormalities, promptly report them to the ward medical or nursing staff.
