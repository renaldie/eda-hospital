(2) The elastic straps should be tightened to about one finger width.

(3) Do not wear it too low, as this may compress the inguinal region; the upper part of the buttocks should be comfortably supported.

(4) The main steel plates should be symmetrically fixed on both sides of the lower back and lumbar vertebrae.

Wear the back brace before getting out of bed.  
Please follow the doctor's instructions regarding the duration of wearing the back brace.  
No need to wear the back brace while sleeping or bathing.

2. Activity-related precautions:

(1) Avoid sudden or forceful twisting of the waist.  
(2) Take a shower to maintain a straight lumbar spine.  
(3) It is only safe to drive a car or ride a motorcycle after 3 to 4 weeks post-surgery.  
(4) Avoid pushing, pulling, lifting, or carrying heavy objects, as well as long-distance travel or prolonged sitting.

a. When standing, tuck the chin, lift the head, keep the back straight, contract the abdominal muscles, and tighten the pelvis to reduce pressure on the back.  
b. Only after evaluation by a doctor can you determine whether to adopt a squatting posture to pick up items.  
c. When lifting objects, separate your legs, squat down, tighten your glutes and abdominal muscles, bring your body close to the object, keep your lumbar spine straight, and lower your pelvis—let your gluteal and leg muscles bear the weight of the object.  
d. Wear flat shoes, avoid sandals and high heels, to maintain body balance.
