## Understanding Colon Cancer

## Six. Treatment Methods

- Surgical treatment: If the tumor is confined within the intestine and there is no distant organ metastasis, surgery is the most effective treatment. Depending on the tumor location and condition, partial or total intestinal resection via open or minimally invasive surgery is performed, along with temporary colostomy.

- Chemotherapy: Applicable for mid-to-late stage or metastatic colorectal cancer, it inhibits cancer cell growth and division.

- Radiotherapy: For rectal cancer patients, radiotherapy is commonly used pre- or post-surgery to shrink the tumor or reduce the risk of recurrence.

Targeted therapy and immunotherapy: Targeted drugs for specific gene mutations or therapies that enhance the immune system.

## Seven. Prevention Strategies

Healthy diet: Maintain a high-fiber, low-fat diet, and consume more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while reducing intake of red and processed meats.

Regular screening: Individuals aged 50–75 years can undergo a free fecal occult blood test every two years. High-risk groups, such as those with a family history of colorectal cancer, positive fecal occult blood test results, or obesity, should follow their physician's advice for follow-up checks every 1–3 years.

• Quit smoking and limit alcohol consumption

Maintain a healthy weight and engage in regular physical activity
