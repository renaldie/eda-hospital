## Precautions:

(1) After returning home, it is recommended to perform home rehabilitation exercises four times a day, each session lasting about 30 minutes.  

(2) For each exercise, maintain a duration of 5~15 seconds based on the recovery status of the surgical site.  

(3) After each exercise, apply ice for 10~15 minutes, and take prescribed medications as directed by your doctor to effectively control pain in the affected leg, which will lead to better rehabilitation outcomes.  

(4) If intense pain occurs during exercise, seek medical attention immediately and receive appropriate medical treatment.  

(5) For 6~8 weeks post-surgery, use a walker to walk, to prevent falls, until your doctor during outpatient follow-up deems it safe to resume normal activities.  

(6) Within three months post-surgery, when going up stairs, lead with the unaffected leg; when going down stairs, lead with the affected leg to protect the surgical site. Refer to page 26 of the health education booklet for reference.  

Going up and down stairs carries a risk of falling; it is recommended that family members accompany the patient.
