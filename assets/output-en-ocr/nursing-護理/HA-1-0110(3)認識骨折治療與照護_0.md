## Understanding Fracture Treatment and Care

## 1. What is a Fracture?

A fracture refers to the breaking or deformation of a bone due to direct or indirect external force, resulting in damage to bone tissue. It may also involve injury to surrounding muscles, soft tissues, and nerves.

## 2. Classification of Fractures

1. Simple fracture / Closed fracture: The fracture site shows only a crack, with no skin damage.

2. Comminuted fracture / Complete fracture: The bone breaks completely into two ends or shatters into multiple fragments.

3. Complex fracture / Open fracture: The skin or mucous membranes near the fracture site are damaged, and the broken bone comes into contact with the skin or the external environment.

## 3. Symptoms of a Fracture:

Pain, severe cases may also involve internal bleeding, swelling, and compression or damage to surrounding major nerves, arteries, and veins.

## 4. Treatment Methods:

1. For simple fractures where displacement is minimal or the fracture is located in a less vulnerable area, conservative treatment may be considered, using splints or casts for immobilization.

2. For complex, complete, or open fractures, surgical realignment and fixation are required. Surgical methods include:

(1) Internal fixation: Using surgical procedures such as bone pins or plates to stabilize the fracture site.

(2) External fixation: Fixing the fracture site from outside the body.

**V. Pre- and Post-Operative Care for Fracture Patients:**

### 1. Pre-Operative Preparation:

(1) Complete chest X-ray, X-ray of the injured limb, ECG, and blood tests.

(2) After the doctor explains the condition, complete the surgical consent form, anesthesia consent form, and any necessary self-paid medical device consent forms as required.

(3) Begin fasting and fluid restriction 8 hours before surgery (from midnight).

(4) If taking anticoagulant medications (such as anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents) or glucose-lowering drugs (such as SGLT2 inhibitors), follow the doctor's instructions to take or discontinue medication, and proactively inform medical staff.

(5) For lower limb fractures, the affected limb is typically not allowed to bear full weight after surgery. Prepare a walker or crutches accordingly.

2. Post-Operative Care Guidelines:

(1) If there is a drainage tube at the wound site, it must be placed on the same side as the surgical site and should be avoided from pulling or tugging to maintain patency and prevent dislodgement.

(2) Post-surgical pain at the wound site: The doctor will prescribe oral pain medication to be taken regularly. If pain persists more than one hour after taking the pain medication, inform the nursing staff for assessment. Additional pain medication may be administered as prescribed.

(3) Use a blanket, pillow, or elevated pillow to raise the surgical limb above heart level to reduce swelling and discomfort.

(4) Begin turning every 2 hours after surgery. On the first day, raise the head of the bed at least three times daily, and perform deep breathing exercises regularly to maintain airway patency.

(5) To reduce pain at the wound site and minimize limb swelling and discomfort, local cold compresses may be applied as prescribed. Each session should last 15–20 minutes, with a total of four applications per day.
