7. To prevent incontinence of urine or feces from contaminating the body, it is necessary to first put on disposable nappies, then dress the deceased in clothes, shoes, socks, and other items prepared by family members.

8. According to the instructions of medical and nursing staff, remove various tubes from the body, such as urinary catheters, tracheostomy tubes, and nasogastric tubes (before removal, aspirate gastric contents first).

9. If the deceased used dentures, they can be placed back in the mouth to maintain a complete appearance.

10. If necessary, light makeup can be applied to make the deceased's appearance more peaceful.

Family members may offer a farewell message to the deceased, such as: "Thank you for your contributions to the family and for the love shown by family members toward the patient; please let go and say goodbye, and follow your faith (God, Buddha, etc.) as you leave..."

## Issuance of Death Certificate

How to obtain a death certificate due to illness or natural death:

(1) Patients who pass away in the hospital:

For patients who pass away in the hospital, the medical team in charge during hospitalization will issue the death certificate.

Approximately 10 copies of the death certificate are required (the number can be increased according to family needs).

## (2) Patients who pass away at home:

[If the patient is returned home due to critical condition, remember! Before discharge, apply to the medical team for a critical condition diagnosis certificate.]

Prepare a clean white sheet of paper. Have immediate family members or a spouse record the year, month, day, hour, and minute of the patient's death. Carry with you the death time certificate, critical condition diagnosis certificate, original identity card of the deceased, original household registration book, and official seals, and request a medical professional from the village health center or local practicing medical institution to conduct a post-mortem examination and assist in issuing the certificate.
