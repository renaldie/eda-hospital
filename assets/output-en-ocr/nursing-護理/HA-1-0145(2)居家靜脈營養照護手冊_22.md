## (3) Diet:

For patients receiving central venous nutrition therapy, it is almost impossible to absorb nutrients through the mouth or gastrointestinal tract. When a patient's condition improves, doctors will assess whether oral feeding is possible. Since each patient has different physical conditions, do not encourage patients to try oral intake without first discussing with medical staff.

(4) Urination and defecation:

Central venous nutrition therapy may lead to frequent nighttime urination, which can affect sleep. In such cases, discuss with your doctor to adjust the timing of nutrient infusion. Additionally, consider whether the locations for urination and defecation are convenient. If physical strength decreases, consider renting or purchasing a commode chair to prevent falls.

(5) Clothing:

Choose loose, button-up clothing, and secure the infusion set with tape to avoid pulling on the catheter when changing clothes.

(6) Living environment:

If you do not have a portable infusion stand, you can install hooks at home that can support the IV bags.
