Dysphagia

23% to 50% of acute stroke patients will experience dysphagia

Dysphagia increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary infections, and malnutrition, leading to prolonged hospital stays and higher stroke mortality rates.

1. Texture selection: If liquids cause coughing or choking, food thickening agents can be added.  
(The consistency should be adjusted according to the therapist's recommendation.)

2. Posture adjustment: It is recommended to eat in a head-down position, and head-tilt posture should be avoided as much as possible.  
(Please follow the therapist's advice.)

The following signs indicate potential swallowing difficulties:

1. Food remains in the mouth or spills out during eating.  
2. Coughing or choking frequently when eating or swallowing.  
3. Inability to naturally close the corners of the mouth, with saliva leaking from the mouth.
