# Recognizing and Basic Management of Inflammation Related to Peritoneal Dialysis (Peritonitis, Inflammation at the Catheter Exit Site, Tunnel Inflammation)

## I. Peritonitis

**(1) Symptoms:**

1. Cloudy dialysate.

2. Abdominal pain.

3. Fever, chills.

4. Gastrointestinal symptoms: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation.

5. Fibrous material in the drainage fluid.

6. Worsening of peritoneal dialysis dehydration.

7. Difficulty with catheter drainage.

**(2) Basic Management:**

1. When cloudy dialysate is observed, peritonitis may have occurred.

2. Immediately contact the peritoneal dialysis nurse to report the situation and proposed management, and go to the hospital for examination and treatment.

3. If cloudy drainage fluid is noticed after 17:00 on weekdays or on weekends and holidays, bring with you the usual dialysate solution, mask, scale, hand tissue, and 75% alcohol for emergency department visit.

4. Before coming to the hospital, confirm that dialysate has been infused into the abdomen; after 2 hours, the fluid can be drained to check for bacterial infection. Upon arrival at the hospital, the abdominal dialysate will be drained and handed over to the nurse for testing.

5. After the dialysate test results are available, if the bacterial count exceeds the standard value, peritonitis is confirmed, and the physician will prescribe antibiotics.

6. If there is no fever or severe abdominal pain, and after consultation and approval by the nephrology physician, antibiotics can be self-administered at home by adding them directly into the dialysate bag. After receiving instruction from the peritoneal dialysis nurse on how to add antibiotics to the dialysate bag, patients can return home to self-administer the medication.

7. Important note: If the drainage fluid remains cloudy after 3 days at home, or if abdominal pain or edema occurs, contact the peritoneal dialysis unit immediately.

## II. Inflammation at the Catheter Exit Site:

**(1) Abnormal catheter exit site:** If any of the following conditions occur, contact the peritoneal dialysis nurse immediately.

1. Redness, swelling, heat, pain, or discharge at the wound site.

2. The button (sleeve) slipping off and protruding at the exit site.

3. The hair-covered sleeve button slipping off, exposing the wound.

4. The wound showing granulation tissue, or an unstable wound.
