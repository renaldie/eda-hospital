## Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

## Introduction:

Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition caused by compression of the median nerve by the flexor retinaculum in the wrist, leading to numbness and pain in the wrist and palm.

## Causes:

The exact cause is unknown, but any condition that increases pressure within the carpal tunnel can trigger symptoms. These include rheumatoid arthritis, pregnancy, hypothyroidism, obesity of the extremities, ganglion cysts, tendinitis, hemodialysis, diabetes, and individuals who perform repetitive hand movements, such as carpenters, typists, and tailors.

## Symptoms:

Patients are often middle-aged women or individuals who frequently use their hands in physically demanding tasks. A typical symptom is waking up with pain and a sensation of swelling in the hand. Numbness and pain occur in the areas innervated by the median nerve, usually involving the wrist, palm, and the first three fingers, and occasionally radiating to the proximal forearm, shoulder, neck, or chest. The affected limb often feels heavy and numb in the morning. Patients typically shake their hands, get up and move around, or soak their hands in warm water to relieve discomfort. Early examinations usually show no abnormalities. In later stages, the hand may become paralyzed, and the muscles in the palm and fingers may atrophy. Approximately 70% of patients experience numbness or tingling when their wrist is bent for one minute, or the symptoms become more pronounced.

## Treatment:

$ ^{*} $ Conservative treatment:

1. Injecting corticosteroids into the carpal tunnel.

2. Taking oral anti-inflammatory medications.

3. Wearing a wrist splint to maintain a $ 10^{\circ} \sim 20^{\circ} $ dorsiflexion position of the wrist.

4. These treatments can temporarily alleviate symptoms but do not provide a cure.

$ ^{*} $ Surgical treatment:

A "release procedure" is performed to decompress the carpal tunnel, providing permanent relief from pain. The surgery is conducted under local anesthesia, with a wound located on the palmar side of the wrist, approximately 1.5 cm in size, and takes about 20 minutes. Muscle strength should gradually recover post-surgery, unless significant atrophy or prolonged muscle wasting has already occurred.

$ ^{*} $ Postoperative precautions:

1. Normal eating can resume immediately after surgery.

2. The surgical site will be wrapped with elastic gauze and a wrist splint. Please do not remove it yourself without following the doctor's instructions.

3. Pay attention to whether any abnormal sensations in the fingers (such as numbness or weakness) have improved.

4. The joints of the fingers outside the splint can move freely, and the affected limb should be kept elevated to prevent local swelling.

5. Change dressings daily, 1–2 times per day, and keep the wound dry. The wound will typically be sutured after 10 to 14 days depending on healing progress.

6. After suture removal, the wrist should be maintained in the position fixed by the splint (ideally in the natural resting position), with the fixation period lasting approximately one month.

7. After removing the wrist splint, gradually and progressively increase activities involving hand, wrist, and finger joint extension to prevent nerve adhesion.
