## Sinusitis

## I. Definition of Sinusitis

Sinusitis refers to inflammatory changes in the mucous membranes of the nasal cavity.

## II. Classification of Sinusitis

1. Acute sinusitis: Often caused by bacterial infections, commonly occurring after a cold due to bacterial infection.

2. Chronic sinusitis: Primarily results from allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinitis, or prolonged colds that block the sinus passages, allowing bacteria to grow and become infected and inflamed within the sinuses.

## III. Symptoms

1. Yellow thick nasal discharge; nasal secretions appear yellow to dark brown.

2. Headache.

3. Cough with phlegm.

4. Nasal congestion.

5. Loss of smell.

6. Ear ringing.

7. Postnasal drip.

8. Pain and tenderness in the cheek area.

## IV. Treatment Methods

1. Treat colds promptly to keep nasal passages open.

2. Steam inhalation helps constrict blood vessels in the nasal mucosa and improves sinus drainage.

3. Seek medical advice to receive appropriate antibiotics; treatment typically lasts 10 to 14 days.

## V. Self-care Tips

1. Inhale warm steam, which helps open nasal passages.

2. Drink a warm beverage, which can provide some relief.

3. Use a humidifier to prevent dryness in the nasal cavity and nasal passages.

4. Increase fluid intake; drinking large amounts of fluids daily helps dilute mucus and maintain its flow.

5. Exercise helps stimulate the adrenal glands to release hormones that constrict blood vessels, helping reduce sinus swelling.

6. Gently rub the painful sinus area with the palm of your hand to promote fresh blood flow to the region and alleviate discomfort.

7. Cover the eyes and forehead with a warm towel to relieve sinus pain.
