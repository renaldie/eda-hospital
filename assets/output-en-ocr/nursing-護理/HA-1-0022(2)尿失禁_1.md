## Urinary Incontinence

One, What is urinary incontinence: "A state of confirmed involuntary urine leakage that causes social and hygiene problems" is referred to as urinary incontinence.

Two, Urinary incontinence can be divided into the following types:

1. Urgency incontinence: Urine leaks out before one can reach the toilet when experiencing a sudden urge to urinate. This often leads to acute or chronic urinary tract infections and unstable bladder.

2. Stress incontinence: Leakage occurs during any abdominal strain, such as coughing, jumping, going downstairs, or lifting heavy objects. This commonly occurs after childbirth or after menopause.

3. Overflow incontinence: The bladder lacks contraction force, and urine slowly seeps out through the urethra once it becomes full. This often occurs in patients with diabetes or after a stroke.

4. Prolapse incontinence: Urine leaks continuously throughout the day, commonly seen in patients with severe damage to the urinary tract or urethral tissue.

Three, Why women are more prone to urinary incontinence:

1. Inherently shorter urinary tracts.

2. Prone to urinary tract infections.

3. Pelvic floor muscles and ligaments become loose after pregnancy and childbirth.

4. Atrophy of the urethra and vaginal tissues after menopause.

5. Direct or indirect damage to the bladder and urethral tissues due to pelvic surgery.

6. Aging—women constitute the majority of the elderly population.

Four, Treatment of urinary incontinence:

1. Behavioral therapy, pelvic floor muscle training.

2. Medication therapy: such as pro-banthine, Ditropan, Tofranil, Detrusito, etc.

3. Injection of collagen or autologous fat around the urethra.

4. Surgical therapy:

(1) Electrical inhibition of micturition reflex is one method of treating urinary incontinence.

(2) Implantation of an artificial urethral sphincter can help some patients control urination.

(3) Bulking procedure of the bladder neck ligament suspension.
