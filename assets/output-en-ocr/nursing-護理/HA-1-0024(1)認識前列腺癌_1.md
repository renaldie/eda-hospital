## Understanding Prostate Cancer

## I. Introduction:

Prostate cancer is mostly a malignant tumor found in elderly men. The risk increases with age. Almost all men over 50 suffer from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is a benign tumor. However, if it is prostate cancer, it is a malignant tumor, primarily characterized by urinary obstruction.

## II. Common Sites of Occurrence:

Prostate cancer originates from the epithelial cells of the prostate gland. If the tumor grows within the glandular tissue, it may invade the urethra and bladder.

## III. Possible Symptoms:

Prostate cancer develops slowly, and early-stage cases may present no symptoms. As the tumor grows larger, urinary difficulties may appear. As the disease progresses, patients may experience pain in the perineal area and abdominal swelling. In advanced stages, bone pain due to metastasis may occur.

## IV. Examination:

1. Clinical history and family history review.

2. Pathological examination via digital rectal examination (DRE): The doctor will wear gloves, apply a lubricant containing an anesthetic, and insert a finger into the patient's rectum to examine the prostate. Early prostate cancer may feel like a small hard lump during DRE.

3. Blood test: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Normal range: 0–4 ng/ml.

4. Transrectal ultrasound of the prostate: When a tumor is suspected or a mass is palpable, this examination helps with physical assessment. Patients should fast for 6–8 hours before the test to reduce intestinal gas.

5. If necessary, a biopsy may be performed to enable further pathological diagnosis. After confirming a prostate cancer diagnosis, doctors will arrange additional tests to assess the extent and spread of the disease, such as chest X-ray, intravenous pyelogram (IVP), computed tomography scan (CT scan), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or whole-body bone scan. If needed, laparoscopic pelvic lymph node dissection may be performed to remove lymph nodes for pathological examination, determining the extent of cancer spread.

## V. Staging of Prostate Cancer Based on Local Invasion or Spread:

◎ Stage A: This is an early stage with no spread. The tumor is not palpable during digital rectal examination. Patients often undergo surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and subsequent pathological examination reveals the presence of cancer cells within the prostate tissue.

☐ Stage B: Also refers to cancer without spread, but the tumor can be palpated during digital rectal examination.

◎ Stage C: The prostate cancer has invaded surrounding tissues of the prostate.

Stage D indicates the presence of lymph nodes in the pelvic region or metastasis to other organs such as bones.

## VI. Treatment:

For early-stage prostate cancer, if the patient is under 70 years old, the optimal treatment is radical prostatectomy. For patients over 70 years old who also have symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia, combined treatment with transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and oral hormone therapy may be considered. Early or locally spread prostate cancer can also be treated with radiation therapy. For example, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) can avoid complications associated with conventional radiation therapy. Metastatic prostate cancer can be treated with hormone therapy or drug-based therapies that deliver radioactive substances directly to metastatic lesions.

## VII. Post-Operative Care:

(1) Wound care: Nursing staff will monitor wound changes and change dressings regularly. Most patients can have stitches removed about one week after surgery.

(1) Prevention and early detection of postoperative complications:

a. In case of shock: Report to the doctor and follow medical instructions
