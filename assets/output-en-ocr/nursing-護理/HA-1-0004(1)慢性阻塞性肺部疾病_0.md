$ ^{*} $ Maintain an appropriate working height; keep items close to your body, minimize body movement during activities, and perform tasks while sitting whenever possible. For example, brush your teeth or wash your face while seated; during bathing, use a long-handled brush, and place a chair or stool in the bathroom.
