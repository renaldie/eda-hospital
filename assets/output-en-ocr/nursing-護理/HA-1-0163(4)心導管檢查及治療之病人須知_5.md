## Four. What are the complications of cardiac catheterization?

Severe complications include arrhythmia, acute myocardial infarction, vascular injury, stroke, renal dysfunction caused by contrast agent, and cardiac tamponade, with an average incidence of less than 1%.

## Five. Precautions during cardiac catheterization

## (1) Before catheterization:

1. Physiological assessment: blood draw, electrocardiogram, X-ray examination.

2. Informed consent: must include consent and signature from both the patient and family.

3. Skin preparation: to reduce infection during the procedure, it is recommended to shave both inguinal areas (common sites are wrists or inguinal regions).

4. Fasting: If the procedure is scheduled for the next morning, fast after midnight (including water and food). If the procedure is scheduled in the afternoon, eat breakfast (finish by 7 AM), and then begin fasting (including water and food) after breakfast.

5. On the day of the examination, remove all metal accessories and removable dentures. If nail polish or lipstick is applied, clean it thoroughly.

6. Wear patient's clothing on the day of the examination, without underwear or pants.

7. Medical history: if you have a history of allergies (such as previous allergic reaction to contrast agents) or persistent bleeding, please inform the physician in advance.

8. Pulse examination: nursing staff will measure your blood pressure and pulse, and mark the pulse points on both feet to facilitate comparison of pulse strength before and after the procedure.

9. Empty your bladder before the examination.

## (2) During catheterization:

1. Local disinfection and anesthesia are performed. A special catheter is inserted through a blood vessel at the arm or inguinal area, and guided along the vessel to reach the heart.
