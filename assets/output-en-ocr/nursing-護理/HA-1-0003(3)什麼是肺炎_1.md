## What is pneumonia

## 1. What is pneumonia?

Pneumonia is an acute inflammation of the lungs, which can occur in all age groups, especially in individuals with weakened immune function, such as the elderly, alcoholics, or patients with diabetes. Although antibiotics are available for treatment, the incidence remains high and pneumonia can be fatal.

## 2. Causes

1. Infectious: caused by bacterial, viral, or other microbial infections.

2. Non-infectious: such as exposure to toxic gases or chemicals, aspiration of water, food, or vomit, or autoimmune-related diseases.

3. Impaired protective mechanisms: such as inhibition of mucus-ciliary clearance, for example due to smoking or congenital diseases.

4. Presence of risk factors: older age, swallowing difficulties, long-term bed rest, cancer, or obstructive lung diseases, which lead to increased secretion or impaired clearance of secretions from the lungs.

## 3. Examination

1. Physical examination.

2. Chest X-ray.

3. Sputum culture.

4. Arterial blood gas analysis.

## 4. Common symptoms
