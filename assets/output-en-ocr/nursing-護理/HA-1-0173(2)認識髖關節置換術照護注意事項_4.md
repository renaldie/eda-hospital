Please bring your regularly taken medications, along with the medication bottles and packaging, to the hospital on the day of admission and hand them over to the nursing staff. This will allow medical and nursing personnel to understand your medication history. If you are taking anticoagulant medications (such as anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents) or glucose-lowering medications (such as SGLT2 inhibitors), please follow the doctor's instructions to take or discontinue them, and proactively inform the medical and nursing staff.
