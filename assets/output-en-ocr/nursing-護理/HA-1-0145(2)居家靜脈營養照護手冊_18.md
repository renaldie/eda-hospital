Disinfection schedule: Disinfect and change the dressing once per week; change it immediately if sweating or soiled.

Steps:

1. Wash hands with soap or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

2. Remove the soiled dressing, and check whether the catheter has slipped out or if there is any sign of inflammation around the skin (pay attention to whether there is pus or redness at the injection site).

4. Perform disinfection method: disinfect in a circular motion from inside out, covering an area larger than the sterile transparent dressing. The sequence is 10% iodine alcohol → hold for 30 seconds → 75% alcohol, repeated three times.

4. Secure the sterile transparent dressing (OP SITE) (see Table 2). (For individuals allergic to the sterile transparent dressing, use gauze coverage, but the dressing must be changed daily).
