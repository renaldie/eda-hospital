(9) Consume sufficient calories daily. In terms of diet, increase intake of protein such as fish, meat, eggs, and dairy products. Supplement calcium (e.g., small fish dried, raisins, sesame seeds, nori) and vitamin D (through sun exposure) to replenish lost nutrients and promote bone and wound healing.

(10) It is recommended to reduce the use of stimulants such as coffee, strong tea, smoking, and alcohol, as these substances may prolong the healing time of fractures.

(11) The degree of weight-bearing on the injured limb should follow the instructions given by the physician after assessment.

(12) Passive muscle contraction exercises can be performed on the affected limb to promote blood circulation. (Finger clenched and relaxed exercise) as shown in Figure 1, (dorsiflexion and flexion of the foot) as shown in Figure 2. Perform approximately ten repetitions per hour according to physical capacity, but avoid vigorous movements.
