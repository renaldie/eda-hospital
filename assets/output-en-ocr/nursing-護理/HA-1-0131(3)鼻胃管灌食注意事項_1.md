## Nasogastric Tube Feeding Precautions

## 1. Definition: Providing nutrition or medication to patients via a nasogastric tube.

## 2. Applicable Population: Patients who cannot eat orally but have intact or partial gastrointestinal function.

## 3. Care Methods and Precautions

## (1) Pre-Feeding Precautions

★ Raise the head of the bed to 30–60 degrees before feeding to prevent aspiration; maintain a high-lying or sitting position for at least 30 minutes after feeding.

★ Check the position of the nasogastric tube. If any of the following occur, pause feeding: loose adhesive tape, the patient's mouth showing the tube has been dislodged or is tangled around the mouth.

★ Use a syringe to aspirate for gastric content to confirm that the tube is properly positioned in the stomach.

★ Assess gastric motility by observing the color and volume of gastric contents. If more than 100 mL is aspirated, temporarily suspend feeding; however, the aspirated fluid can be re-administered into the stomach and does not need to be discarded.

★ If the aspirated fluid is dark green, dark red, white, or coffee-colored, inform medical or nursing staff and suspend feeding immediately.

## (2) Feeding Precautions

★ Connect the syringe to the nasogastric tube and use gravity to pour the food into the syringe. Hold the syringe at a height of 15–20 cm above the patient's nose or ensure the liquid level is 30–45 cm above the gastric level to allow the liquid to flow slowly.

★ If the food is too thick, add a small amount of warm water to dilute it, facilitating feeding.

★ If it feels difficult to administer the feeding, possible causes include food blocking the tube outlet or the tube tip touching the gastric wall. In such cases, notify medical or nursing staff immediately.

★ If coughing or respiratory distress occurs during feeding, stop immediately and notify medical or nursing staff or seek emergency medical care.

## (3) Post-Feeding Precautions

★ Administer 30 mL of warm water to flush the nasogastric tube to prevent blockage or foul odor from food remaining in the tube.

★ Fold the opening of the nasogastric tube and plug it with a plug or seal to prevent air from entering the stomach.

★ Clean the syringe with cold water during feeding to prevent the syringe from deforming due to heat and to avoid contamination of the tube, which could lead to diarrhea in the patient.
