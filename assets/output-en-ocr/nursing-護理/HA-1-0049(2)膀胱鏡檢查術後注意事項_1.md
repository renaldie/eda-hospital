## Post-procedure precautions for cystoscopy

## I. Precautions:

☐ For patients under general anesthesia, food can be consumed once fully awake. Try drinking a small amount of liquid (such as water, sugar water, milk, or juice). If there is no nausea or vomiting, you may begin consuming liquid foods such as rice porridge or clear porridge.

☐ After the procedure, you may experience increased frequency of urination, pain during urination, or hematuria. These are all normal phenomena and you should not be overly alarmed.
