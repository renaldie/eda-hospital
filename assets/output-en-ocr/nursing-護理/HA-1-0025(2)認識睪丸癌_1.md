## Understanding Testicular Cancer

**I. Causes:**

The exact cause of testicular cancer is not well understood. Among congenital factors, cryptorchidism (undescended testes) is the most significant—men with cryptorchidism have over 10 times the risk of developing testicular cancer compared to those without. Additionally, maternal use of hormonal medications during pregnancy increases the likelihood of cryptorchidism in male infants. As for acquired factors, trauma or infection leading to testicular atrophy are also associated with this disease.

**II. Possible Symptoms:**

Approximately 10% of patients are asymptomatic and are discovered incidentally after trauma or by their sexual partners. The most common symptoms are painless enlargement of the testicle with a heavy, dull sensation. Some patients may also experience hydrocele (fluid accumulation in the scrotum), gynecomastia (development of male breast tissue), and acute pain due to internal bleeding or obstruction in the testicle in about 10% of cases. Another 10% may present with metastatic symptoms such as back pain, coughing, or hemoptysis (coughing up blood).

**III. Examination:**

1. Physical examination  
2. Scrotal ultrasound  
3. CT scan and MRI  
4. Blood tests: such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)

**IV. Common Types of Testicular Cancer:**

1. **Seminoma:**  
   Most commonly seen in men aged 40–50 years. Typical seminomas account for about 85% of all seminomas. The tumor appears as a firm, grayish nodule within the testicle. This type is highly sensitive to radiation therapy and responds very well to radiotherapy.

2. **Embryonal Carcinoma:**  
   Divided into two types: adult-type and pediatric-type. The pediatric-type is also known as yolk sac tumor and is the most common testicular tumor in prepubertal children, occurring in 75% of cases before age two. It rarely metastasizes to retroperitoneal lymph nodes but tends to spread via the bloodstream to the lungs. The adult-type tumor often coexists with other tissue types.

3. **Teratoma:**  
   Histologically, it arises from all three germ layers and contains tissues such as bone, cartilage, muscle, fat, neural tissue, and skin.

4. **Choriocarcinoma:**  
   This tumor has small lesions but frequently exhibits central hemorrhage and early hematogenous metastasis. It is a highly aggressive and malignant tumor.

5. **Mixed Tumor:**  
   Over a quarter of patients have teratoma, which may be a mixed teratoma with embryonal carcinoma. It may also be a combination of seminoma with other types of cancer cells.

**V. Staging:**

- **Stage I:** The tumor is confined within the testicle.  
- **Stage II A:** Enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, but less than 10 cm in size.  
- **Stage II B:** Enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, greater than 10 cm in size.  
- **Stage III:** Metastasis to lymph nodes above the diaphragm or to internal organs.

Treatment for testicular cancer depends on tumor type, extent of invasion, and stage. Generally, testicular cancer is broadly categorized into seminoma and non-seminoma. For early-stage seminoma (Stage I and Stage II A), radical orchiectomy combined with retroperitoneal radiotherapy is typically used, with a cure rate of approximately 95%. If recurrence occurs after radiotherapy, chemotherapy is added.  

For advanced seminoma (Stage II B and Stage III), chemotherapy is initially administered, with about 90% of patients responding effectively. For early-stage non-seminoma, radical orchiectomy is performed. Whether to proceed with retroperitoneal lymph node dissection is not universally agreed upon and varies among institutions. If recurrence occurs, further surgery or chemotherapy may be considered. For advanced non-seminoma, radical orchiectomy combined with chemotherapy is the standard approach.
