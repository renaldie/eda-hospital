## Tracheostomy Care

▶ Perform tracheostomy care at least once daily. If the gauze or tracheostomy fixation band is wet or dirty, replace it immediately.

When using povidone-iodine to disinfect the tracheostomy site, hold it for 2 minutes to achieve effective disinfection.

The disinfection area should extend beyond the gauze to prevent contamination of the new gauze.

Daily observe the skin around the tracheostomy for signs of inflammation such as redness, swelling, or discharge.

When changing the tracheostomy fixation band, secure the tracheostomy tube to prevent dislodgement.

The tightness of the tracheostomy fixation band should leave about two finger widths of space to avoid being too tight or too loose.

Silicone tracheostomy tubes should be replaced once per month.

Re-establish communication methods, such as using written notes, gestures, or lip reading.

## Catheter Care

If the patient requires close monitoring of urine output or has acute urinary retention and a catheter is placed, improper catheter care can lead to infection. Therefore, the perineal area and catheter should be cleaned daily.

5. The urine collection bag should be positioned below the bladder, with the bag opening at least 3 cm above the ground, and the opening should be kept closed at all times. When the urine volume in the bag reaches 1/2 to 2/3, it should be emptied.
