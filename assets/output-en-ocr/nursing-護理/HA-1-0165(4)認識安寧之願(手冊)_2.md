## A Peaceful and Safe Heart

It is only through the convergence of circumstances that we are able to gather here today. When the time comes for these circumstances to end, that will be the moment when we say goodbye to each other! Although we may not have been able to get along well in the past, we hope that at this final moment we can make the most of it, so that both of us can find peace in life and death.

Just like the rising and setting of the sun, even with all the sorrow and pain, we must accompany each other through the final journey of life. We are willing to help you care for your beloved family members and assist them in drawing a perfect conclusion at the end of their life journey.
