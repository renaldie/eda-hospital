## Management of Hypotension and Hypertension

## One: What is Hypotension?

When the systolic pressure (the higher number) or diastolic pressure (the lower number) is lower than usual blood pressure by 20–30 mmHg, it indicates a possible state of hypotension.

## Two: Causes of Hypotension:

(1) Excessive fluid loss (fluid lost + urine output exceeds the amount of fluid consumed).

(2) Severe vomiting, diarrhea, or excessive sweating.

(3) Sudden loss of appetite and inability to eat.

(4) Overuse of blood pressure-lowering medications.

(5) During infection.

(6) When there are signs of bleeding in the body.

## Three: Symptoms of Hypotension:

Dizziness, fatigue, pale complexion, sweating, muscle cramps in the feet, tinnitus (especially due to excessive dehydration).

## Four: Management of Low Blood Pressure:

(1) Lie down immediately and rest.

(2) Supplement with saline solution.

(3) Recheck blood pressure after 10–15 minutes.

(4) Whether to reduce the dosage of blood pressure medication and the use of 2.5% or 4.25% dialysis fluid should be discussed with the nephrology or peritoneal dialysis team.

## Five: Precautions:

(1) After blood pressure stabilizes, slowly sit up and then measure blood pressure again. If blood pressure remains stable, sitting rest is acceptable. When blood pressure drops again, recommend lying down and resting until blood pressure stabilizes and no discomfort is present before getting up to move around.

(2) When measuring blood pressure, avoid wearing heavy clothing, and ensure the hand is at the same level as the heart to avoid affecting the accuracy of the reading.

(3) If a low blood pressure reading is obtained, immediately contact the peritoneal dialysis team to report the situation and seek advice.

## Six: What is Hypertension?

When the systolic pressure (the higher number) or diastolic pressure (the lower number) is higher than usual blood pressure by 20–30 mmHg, it indicates a possible state of elevated blood pressure.
