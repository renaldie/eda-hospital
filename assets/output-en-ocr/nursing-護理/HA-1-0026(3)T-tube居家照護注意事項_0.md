# T-tube Home Care

## One. Definition

After biliary surgery, bile swelling may occur postoperatively. To prevent bile from leaking into the peritoneal cavity and to maintain patency of the biliary tract, a T-shaped drainage tube is placed at the common bile duct, draining bile externally. The duration of T-tube retention varies depending on individual patient conditions. The physician will determine the retention period based on imaging studies such as cholangiography and endoscopic examination, typically ranging from several weeks to several months.

## Two. Applicable Patients

1. Patients undergoing common bile duct drainage surgery.  
2. Patients undergoing cholecystectomy.  
3. Patients undergoing other biliary surgical procedures.

## Three. T-tube Wound Care

1. Wash hands thoroughly with soap.  
2. Daily, use normal saline, cold tap water, or cold water to moisten cotton swabs and gently wipe the area around the T-tube from inside out.  
3. After drying, disinfect with povidone-iodine solution, cover with a Y-shaped gauze, and secure with adhesive tape.  
4. Change the gauze at least once daily; increase the frequency according to the amount of exudate from the wound.  

5. Keep the area around the tube clean and dry to avoid irritation to the wound and skin.  
6. The drainage tube should first be shaped into a parabolic curve and then secured in a "Y" shape on the abdomen with adhesive tape to prevent slippage due to pulling. The adhesive position should be changed daily to avoid skin allergies caused by tape. When securing, handle gently to avoid bending or kinking the T-tube, which could lead to obstruction.  
7. The drainage collection bag must not be positioned higher than the drainage tube to prevent backflow and contamination. The collection bag can be appropriately secured on the thigh or waist area.

## Four. Important Notes for T-tube Care

1. Record daily drainage volume and color.  
2. Maintain skin cleanliness.  
3. Change dressings regularly.  
4. Replace the drainage bag regularly.  
5. Avoid strenuous or excessive activities (such as lifting heavy objects, swimming, or running), as these may cause excessive bile leakage. During activity, keep the tube secured at the waist or leg.  
6. If bile spills and soaks clothes, soak the clothes in bleach or baking soda solution before washing.  
7. Seek emergency care if any of the following occur:

(1) Persistent high fever.  
(2) Severe abdominal pain or vomiting.  
(3) Blockage or obstruction of the drainage tube.  
(4) Dislodgement of the drainage tube.  
(5) Redness, swelling, pain, or purulent discharge from the wound site.  
(6) Drainage fluid turns red or drainage volume decreases with abdominal distension and pain.

## Five. Dietary Guidelines:

1. Eat at regular intervals and in measured portions, chew food thoroughly and slowly. After meals, rest for 30 minutes.  
2. Avoid oily, fried, sticky rice-based foods, and gas-producing foods (such as soybeans, onions, and garlic).  
3. Drink sports drinks to replenish body electrolytes.  
4. Ensure adequate rest and avoid overexertion.  
5. Wear loose-fitting clothing to avoid compressing the drainage tube.

## Six. Notes on Closing the T-tube (Only to be performed after physician's instruction)

1. Initially, close the tube for 3 to 4 hours each day, then open it for 15 minutes (as instructed by the physician).  
2. Do not close the tube at night.
