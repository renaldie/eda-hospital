## (二) Cooking methods:

1. Use various low-oil cooking methods such as steaming, boiling, stewing, roasting, braising, and cold-dressing.

2. Minimize the use of frying and deep-frying; if necessary, use only small amounts of plant-based oils.

3. For red-braised or stewed meat dishes, remove the upper layer of fat after refrigeration before reheating and using.

4. Avoid using condiments such as sesame oil, salad dressing, chili sauce, and sambal sauce during meals.
