## 2. Wound Care After Returning Home

### 1. Wash hands before and after touching the wound.

2. Wound disinfection or cleaning should be performed from inside to outside, without back-and-forth wiping. The disinfection area should extend 5 cm beyond the wound margin. When changing the dressing, try to minimize the exposure of the wound to air.

3. Change the dressing once daily (it can be done after bathing). However, if the gauze becomes soaked with blood, gets accidentally wet, or falls off, the dressing must be changed immediately.

4. Keep the wound and gauze clean and dry. Avoid bathing the wound, and prefer using a wiping method instead.

5. Items needed for dressing change preparation:

(1) 20 ml normal saline solution: discard after single use

(2) 4×4 gauze

(3) sterile cotton swabs

(4) water-soluble povidone-iodine: shelf life is one week after opening.
