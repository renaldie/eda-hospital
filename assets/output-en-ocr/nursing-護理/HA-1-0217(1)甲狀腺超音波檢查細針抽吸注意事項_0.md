## Thyroid Ultrasound Fine Needle Aspiration Post-Procedure Precautions

1. After the needle aspiration, press firmly on the aspiration site with your fingers for more than 15 minutes to prevent bleeding. If you experience any discomfort, please immediately inform the doctor.

2. Patients with kidney failure, liver cirrhosis, hemophilia, or other blood disorders are at a higher risk of bleeding after aspiration. Please inform the doctor in advance. For these patients, apply pressure for more than 20 minutes after aspiration.

3. Please return home only after confirming there is no bleeding.

4. After returning home, if swelling, bleeding, or pain occurs at the aspiration site, immediately apply ice. If the symptoms do not improve, please go to the emergency department of our hospital immediately.

5. Avoid hot liquids and food for three hours after aspiration.

※Please schedule a follow-up outpatient appointment one week after the examination to review the results.
