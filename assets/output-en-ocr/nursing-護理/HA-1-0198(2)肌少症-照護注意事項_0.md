# Sarcopenia - Care Considerations

## ● What is sarcopenia?

Often referred to as the invisible killer of elderly disability, the risk of developing sarcopenia increases with age. It can easily lead to falls, fractures, disability, institutionalization, and even higher mortality rates among older adults.

## ● Characteristics of sarcopenia?

Persistent feeling of weakness, inability to walk or stand for long periods, frequent falls, poor grip strength, and in severe cases, complete disability and inability to perform daily living activities.

## ● How to prevent and manage sarcopenia?

1. Regular exercise and fall prevention: Resistance training is particularly effective, such as using dumbbells, water bottles, or elastic bands for strength training. Other options include brisk walking, jogging, swimming, and tai chi.
