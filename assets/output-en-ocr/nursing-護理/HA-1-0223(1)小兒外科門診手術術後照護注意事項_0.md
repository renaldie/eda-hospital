# Postoperative Care Instructions for Pediatric Outpatient Surgical Patients

Proper wound care after pediatric outpatient surgery can prevent wound infection, promote wound healing, and enhance comfort. Early detection of signs of infection and prompt medical attention are essential.

## ☐ Patients after hernia and scrotal edema surgery

## I. Wound Care:

1. The cosmetic adhesive and transparent waterproof dressing should be kept clean and should not be removed by yourself. Wait until your next follow-up visit when the doctor will remove it (you may take a shower but avoid soaking the wound).

2. In male children, slight swelling of the scrotum and bruising in the inguinal region are normal postoperative findings and will gradually resolve. Please do not worry.

## □ Patients after circumcision

## I. Wound Care:

1. Apply ointment several times daily around the wound and glans (note: when applying ointment, pull the prepuce down to expose the glans).

2. Keep the wound clean; you may take a shower but avoid soaking in a bath.

3. For the first two days after surgery, mild prepuce edema is normal and will gradually subside.

## □ Patients after hypospadias surgery

## I. Wound Care:

1. Abdominal wound: The cosmetic adhesive and transparent waterproof dressing should remain in place until your next follow-up visit when the doctor will remove it.

2. Scrotal wound:

(1) Keep the wound dry and avoid wetting it; clean the body using a wiping method.

(2) Clean the wound with a cotton swab dipped in normal saline or boiled cold tap water four times daily, remove any blood stains, and then apply ointment.

(3) Change diapers immediately when they become wet to maintain dryness.

(4) If redness, swelling, heat, pain, or excessive discharge occurs at the wound site, seek medical attention at the outpatient clinic or emergency department immediately.

(5) Mild scrotal swelling after surgery is a normal postoperative reaction and will typically return to normal size within two to three weeks.

## ☐ Patients after subcutaneous tumor surgery

## I. Wound Care:

1. For wounds without sutures, keep the wound clean and do not change the dressing yourself. The dressing will be removed and changed by the doctor during your next follow-up visit.

2. For wounds requiring suture removal, disinfect and apply ointment daily.

## II. Diet:  
After surgery, you may begin consuming liquid foods about two hours post-operation, such as water, sugar water, milk, or fruit juice. If there is no nausea or vomiting after feeding, you may eat any food, regardless of temperature.

## III. Activity:  
There are no activity restrictions after surgery. However, intense physical activities such as running or sports should be avoided until one month after surgery.

## IV. Medication:  
Please take medications as instructed by your doctor.
