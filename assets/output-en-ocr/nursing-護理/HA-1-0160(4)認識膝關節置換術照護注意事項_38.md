## Ten. Postoperative Care and Precautions

## 1. How to Prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis

Avoid prolonged sitting or standing, and when lying in bed, avoid long-term compression of the lower limbs. Do not maintain any posture for too long, such as crossing legs while standing, wearing tight clothing. Maintain a healthy body weight, consume adequate fluids and a low-fat diet, engage in appropriate physical activity, and refrain from smoking.
