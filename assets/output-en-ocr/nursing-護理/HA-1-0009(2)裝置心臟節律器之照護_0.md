## What is a Defibrillator?

An implantable defibrillator is composed of a battery and a small computer chip and is surgically implanted in the upper chest or abdomen. It is primarily used for secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death (ventricular fibrillation). When the computer detects ventricular fibrillation, it delivers an electric current to perform defibrillation and save lives. The defibrillator also adjusts and corrects heart rhythm during slow or fast heartbeats.

During the correction of heart rhythm, patients may feel varying sensations depending on the strength of the current and their body's response—ranging from no sensation to a sudden impact in the chest, or involuntary contractions in the chest or upper arm muscles. These sensations typically last only briefly.

· Post-surgical care and precautions are detailed above.
