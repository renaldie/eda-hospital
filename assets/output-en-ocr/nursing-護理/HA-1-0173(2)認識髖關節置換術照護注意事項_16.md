## 1. How to Prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)

Avoid prolonged sitting or standing. When lying in bed, avoid long-term pressure on the lower limbs. Do not maintain any posture for too long—such as crossing legs while standing, wearing tight clothing. Maintain a healthy body weight, drink adequate fluids, follow a low-fat diet, engage in appropriate physical activity, and avoid smoking.

2. Put them on before getting out of bed in the morning, and remove them when bathing at night (recommended: wear for 8 hours per day, for one month)  
3. Hand-wash and lay flat to dry  
(Do not use a dryer or hang to dry in direct sunlight)
