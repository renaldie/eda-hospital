## Dietary Guidelines No. 2

a. Consume appropriate calories and protein intake to maintain an ideal body weight; a balanced diet is sufficient.

b. Ensure adequate intake of fruits and vegetables to increase dietary fiber, which helps prevent cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia.

C. Use plant-based oils (olive oil, canola oil, sunflower oil, salad oil) as the primary cooking oils, consuming them in moderation, and reduce the use of animal-based fats (butter, cream, lard, tallow).

d. Limit fried, pan-fried, and oily foods; avoid high-fat foods such as animal skin (fish skin, pork skin), fatty meats (five-layer pork, trotters), and processed products (smoked meat, sausages, ham).

e. Consume minimal high-cholesterol foods, such as animal organs, sea urchins, fish roe, crab roe, etc.

f. Reduce intake of high-saturated fat foods, including animal fats (butter, tallow, fatty meats) and processed plant-based oils (plant-based cream, snacks, pastries, bread).

g. Limit consumption of refined sugars (white sugar, fructose), to prevent the development of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia.

h. Use appropriate seasoning without excessive salt intake to prevent hypertension and edema.

i. Patients on long-term steroid therapy should supplement calcium (from high-calcium foods) at a daily dose of 1200–1500 mg.

## Four. Home Care

1. How to monitor rejection reactions, infection symptoms, and drug side effects

(1) Measure and record body temperature and blood pressure daily (once per day).

(2) Observe the frequency, color, and consistency of urine and stool; if tea-colored urine or grayish-white stools are observed, immediately inform the transplant team.

2. Maintain a normal and regular lifestyle: adjust daily routines to remain normal and consistent.

3. Maintain good hygiene habits: both you and your family should maintain good hygiene practices, such as frequent handwashing, brushing teeth or rinsing mouth after meals and eating.

## 4. Activities or Outdoor Visits

(1) Avoid going to crowded places; if unavoidable, wear a mask for protection.

(2) Intense physical activities (such as running, swimming, sexual activity) should be avoided until six months after surgery.

## 5. Dental and Ophthalmic Follow-ups

(1) Regular dental check-ups every six months: inform the dentist of all medications you are taking. If dental treatment is required, preventive antibiotics should be administered beforehand.

(2) Regular ophthalmic examinations every 6 to 12 months: steroids may affect vision.

## 6. Preventive Vaccinations

(1) Hepatitis B vaccination is a top priority before and after liver transplantation.

(2) Inactive vaccines should not be administered; live vaccines (e.g., influenza vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine) can only be given after six months.

(3) Polio vaccination should be replaced with the inactivated form, i.e., the Salk vaccine.

## 7. Other Notes

(1) Avoid indoor plant cultivation or entering plant greenhouses to prevent infection from plant pathogens.

(2) Avoid keeping pets to reduce the risk of vector-borne infections.

(3) If diarrhea occurs and watery stools exceed six times with a duration of over 12 hours, do not immediately use anti-diarrheal medications; instead, return to the hospital for stool culture.
