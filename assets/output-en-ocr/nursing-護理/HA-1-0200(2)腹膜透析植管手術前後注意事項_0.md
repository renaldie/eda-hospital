## Pre- and Post-Operative Care for Peritoneal Dialysis Catheter Placement

## 1. What is Peritoneal Dialysis?

Peritoneal dialysis is a method of treating patients using the peritoneum, a membrane in the abdominal cavity. During surgery, a peritoneal dialysis catheter is implanted into the abdominal cavity through the abdominal wall. This catheter allows dialysis fluid to be infused into the peritoneal cavity. During the dwell period, waste products in the blood pass through the tiny blood vessels of the peritoneum into the dialysis fluid. After a regular interval, the dialysis fluid, now containing waste products, is drained from the abdominal cavity and replaced with a fresh bag of dialysis fluid. This process is repeated daily as prescribed, effectively removing metabolic waste products generated by the body.

Pre-treatment preparation: Before surgery, the patient will undergo preoperative evaluation and explanation by the surgical catheter placement physician, and also receive preoperative assessment and health education from an anesthesiologist. The physician will implant the peritoneal dialysis catheter using either laparoscopic or traditional surgical techniques.

## 2. Why is Catheter Placement Necessary?

When kidney function deteriorates (whether acute or chronic), the kidneys are no longer able to remove metabolic waste products from the blood—such as urea nitrogen and creatinine, which are toxic substances produced during protein metabolism—and excess fluid that would normally be excreted as urine. This condition is known as uremia. Peritoneal dialysis involves infusing specially designed dialysis fluid into the abdominal cavity via a catheter. The dialysis fluid remains in the abdominal cavity for a period of time, during which toxic substances and excess fluid in the blood pass through the microvessels of the peritoneum into the dialysis fluid. The fluid is then drained out through the catheter and replaced with fresh dialysis fluid. This process effectively replaces the function of the kidneys, reducing discomfort caused by the accumulation of toxins and excess fluid in the body, such as confusion, generalized edema, or pulmonary edema.
