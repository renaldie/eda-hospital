(1) Use patient-controlled analgesia: The goal of treatment is to use the minimum effective dose of medication so that the patient can rest in bed without feeling pain, although mild pain may still be felt during severe coughing or movement, with the pain intensity significantly reduced.

(2) Duration of patient-controlled analgesia: After 2–3 days post-surgery, pain gradually decreases over time and can be managed with oral analgesics; at this point, patient-controlled analgesia should be discontinued.

3) Differences between patient-controlled analgesia and traditional analgesia:

(1) Patient-controlled analgesia delivers medication continuously through a machine, and patients can press a button themselves when they feel particularly painful to reduce their pain.

(2) Traditional analgesia is administered only when pain becomes intolerable; the medication begins to take effect after 30 minutes and lasts for 4–6 hours.

(3) Traditional analgesia is covered by the public health insurance; patient-controlled analgesia requires out-of-pocket payment.
