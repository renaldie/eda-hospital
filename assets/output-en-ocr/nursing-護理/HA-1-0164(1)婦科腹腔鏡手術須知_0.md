### 5. Activity Guidance:

Gradual ambulation should be initiated within 24 hours post-surgery,  
and family members must accompany the patient throughout the process.

An abdominal binder can be used to reduce muscle strain during movement.

The head of the bed can be elevated to practice deep breathing, coughing, and turning in bed.

Heavy lifting exceeding 5 kg should be avoided for 6–8 weeks post-surgery,  
and activities such as horseback riding, cycling, prolonged sitting, and intense physical exercise should be avoided for three months to prevent pelvic congestion and discomfort.

</div>

Women who undergo hysterectomy will no longer have menstruation.  
Women who undergo partial myomectomy or unilateral oophorectomy may resume normal menstruation.

Normal sexual activity can generally be resumed after 6–8 weeks post-surgery, when deep pelvic tissues have recovered sufficiently.

If fever, severe abdominal pain, or abnormal vaginal discharge occur after discharge, medical attention should be sought immediately. Address: No. 1, Yida Road, Jiaosu Village, Yanchao District, Kaohsiung City, 824
