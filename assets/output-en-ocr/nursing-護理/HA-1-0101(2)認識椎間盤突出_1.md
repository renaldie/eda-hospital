## Understanding Herniated Disc

## One: Location of the Intervertebral Disc:

The intervertebral disc is located between every two vertebrae. It is composed of cartilage, with a soft nucleus in the center and a strong, tough fibrous ring surrounding it. The intervertebral disc functions to absorb pressure.

## Two: What is a Herniated Disc?

When the intervertebral disc is subjected to sudden force or prolonged pressure, the surrounding ligaments may become damaged or weakened, causing the nucleus pulposus to protrude through the ligament and compress or push against spinal nerves. This condition is known as a herniated disc.

## Three: Causes:

1. Age: Before the age of 30, herniated discs are often caused by sports injuries or carrying heavy loads. After the age of 40, the disc's elasticity decreases, leading to reduced function.

2. Trauma: Falls or collisions.

3. Obesity: Excess body weight increases the load on the lumbar spine.

4. Poor posture.

5. Lifting heavy objects.

## Four: Symptoms:

1. Lower back pain that may radiate to the back of the thigh.

2. Sciatica or cervical nerve pain.

3. Spasms in the upper or lower limb muscles, which worsen during activities such as coughing, defecation, bending forward, or lifting objects.

4. Diminished deep tendon reflexes.

5. Numbness or decreased sensation in the body regions under the nerve supply of the affected area.

## Five: Treatment:

1. Conservative therapy:

(1) Absolute bed rest for two to three weeks until pain subsides.

(2) Medication treatment.

(3) Physical therapy.

2. Surgical treatment:

(1) Microdiscectomy: Removal of the herniated disc fragment under a microscope.

(2) Lamina removal: Surgical removal of part of the lamina to remove the ruptured nucleus pulposus or relieve pressure on the spinal cord.

(3) Spinal fusion: Bone grafts are taken from the iliac crest and implanted into the intervertebral space during spinal surgery, fusing two vertebrae together to achieve stabilization.

## Six: Postoperative Precautions:

1. The duration of bed rest after surgery varies depending on the type of procedure. Typically, patients rest for 1 day after microdiscectomy, 2 days after laminectomy, and 3 days after spinal fusion.

2. During bed rest, daily activities should be assisted by others, and turning should be done using a round roll to reduce the need for back muscle effort.

3. Unless otherwise specified, patients should get up and leave the bed as soon as the urinary catheter is removed.

4. Some patients must follow medical instructions and wear a back brace before sitting up or leaving the bed.

5. Except when lying in bed, patients should wear a back brace at all times to maintain proper posture. For three months, avoid lifting heavy objects or riding bicycles. For one year, avoid excessive strain on the neck, waist, or back.
