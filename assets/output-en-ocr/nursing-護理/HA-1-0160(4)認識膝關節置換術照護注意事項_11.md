## Three. Preoperative Instructions

1. Blood tests, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, and pre-anesthesia evaluation will be completed on the day of admission.

2. To prevent aspiration pneumonia during surgery due to vomiting, patients must fast for 8 hours before surgery. Medical staff will inform patients of the fasting time after 9 p.m. Fasting items include: food, water, and any chewable items such as chewing gum or betel nut.

3. On the day before or on the day of surgery, patients are advised to bathe their affected limb and body.

4. Before surgery, the surgeon will mark the surgical site. Before entering the operating room, medical staff will perform local cleaning of the surgical site and cover it with a dressing.

5. The surgery duration is approximately 4 to 6 hours, depending on individual anesthesia methods and anesthesia recovery time. For patients undergoing general anesthesia, a breathing tube will be placed in the throat during anesthesia to assist with breathing, which may cause throat discomfort or slight blood-tinged sputum. Drinking small amounts of warm water frequently can help alleviate these symptoms. However, if fresh blood is continuously coughed up, patients should immediately inform medical staff for assistance.

6. A family member must accompany the patient throughout the entire surgical procedure and during the transfer back to the ward after surgery.
