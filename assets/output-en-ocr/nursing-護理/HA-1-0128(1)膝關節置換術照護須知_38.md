3. Use a normal saline cotton swab to clean the wound, wiping in a circular motion from the center of the wound outward, gradually expanding to a diameter greater than 5 cm beyond the surrounding area of the wound, avoiding back-and-forth wiping.

Place the gauze, grasp one corner, and pull it out. Position it so that it aligns with the center of the wound, cover the wound, and do not move it again. Secure it with adhesive tape.
