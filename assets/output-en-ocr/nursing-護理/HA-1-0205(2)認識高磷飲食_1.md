(二) Take phosphate-binding medications correctly. Grind the phosphate binders into a fine powder and mix them evenly into food during meals. Do not skip any meal. For example, calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, and the self-paid Fosrenol should be taken with meals to achieve effective blood phosphate reduction. Calcium acetate must be taken with meals to achieve its phosphate-lowering effect.

(三) Take phosphate binders on time, without skipping any meal, including snacks and meals outside the home. Carry the medication when dining out.

(四) Prolonged elevated blood phosphate levels may lead to adverse effects such as skin itching, bone changes, or excessive calcium-phosphate product leading to calcification outside the bones and vascular calcification in various organs.

(五) Regular and adequate dialysis is crucial for removing phosphate from the blood. If necessary, increase the dialysate volume as prescribed by a doctor.

(六) Temporarily discontinue the use of vitamin D3.
