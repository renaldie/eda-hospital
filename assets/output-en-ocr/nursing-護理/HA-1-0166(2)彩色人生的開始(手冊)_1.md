Liver transplantation involves replacing a dysfunctional liver with a healthy one, thereby gradually improving the patient's health status and quality of life. Since the newly implanted liver is recognized by the body's immune system as a foreign object, the immune system will attempt to attack it. To prevent the new liver from being attacked and to avoid rejection, patients must take immunosuppressive drugs for life. These medications increase the risk of infections compared to the general population. However, by paying attention to small daily details and by strictly following medical instructions—including taking medication on time and attending regular outpatient follow-ups—you can gradually return to a quality of life similar to that before the transplant.
