## Introduction

Food and health are closely related. With modern people's diverse daily routines, nutritional imbalance often occurs, leading to various potential diseases. In recent years, medical science has advanced significantly, and diseases that were once considered incurable now have new treatments, cures, or ways to alleviate symptoms, extending patients' lifespans. However, as patients' conditions change during treatment, they may at certain stages be unable to obtain sufficient nutrition through the gastrointestinal tract. In such cases, they may need to rely on intravenous nutrition (commonly known as "nutrition injections" or "infusions") for long-term or temporary support—becoming essential for sustaining life.

To enable you and your family to receive safe infusion nutrition treatment at home, we provide relevant educational content to help you and your family carry out the care of various nutrition infusions at home. This allows for self-care at home while continuing to work, significantly improving your or your family's quality of life.
