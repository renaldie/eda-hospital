## What is Intravenous Patient-Controlled Analgesia

Analgesic drugs are stored in an infusion pump. The dosage is set according to the patient's pain condition. When you feel pain, you can press the control button to receive analgesic drugs through intravenous administration, achieving pain relief.

This is an advanced medication delivery machine. When you feel pain, you can press the medication button yourself, and the machine will inject analgesic drugs, providing rapid pain relief within about 5 minutes.

## Applicable Scope of Patient-Controlled Analgesia

Post-surgical wound pain, other fractures and trauma, cancer pain, etc.

## Common Side Effects

As the drugs used are opioid analgesics, possible uncomfortable symptoms may include: nausea, vomiting, bloating, dizziness, skin itching, difficulty urinating, drowsiness, etc. If you experience any of the above, please inform the nursing staff in the ward to contact the pain nurse for handling.

## How to Use Patient-Controlled Analgesia

Currently, the National Health Insurance does not cover patient-controlled analgesia, so it must be paid out-of-pocket, and refunds or transfers to others are not allowed. If you need it, please inform the pre-anesthesia assessment clinic or the ward nurse of your intention to use it.
