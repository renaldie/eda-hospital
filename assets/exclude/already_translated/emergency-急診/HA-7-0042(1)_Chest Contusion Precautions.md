## Precautions for Chest Contusions

1. After ruling out pneumothorax or rib fractures, chest trauma may still result in potential pulmonary contusions. Close monitoring of the patient's breathing condition is necessary.

2. If there is obvious bruising on the neck, difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, cold sweat, pallor, cyanosis, severe chest pain, or discomfort in the back, medical staff should be informed immediately.

3. After returning home, take medication as prescribed by the physician, rest adequately, avoid strenuous work, and return for follow-up appointments according to the scheduled outpatient department time.

4. If severe symptoms such as hemoptysis or difficulty breathing occur at home, sit upright, avoid feeding and getting out of bed, and contact for consultation or return for medical treatment (Emergency hotline: 615-0995).
