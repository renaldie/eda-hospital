## Coughing Precautions

1. When your throat itches, hold warm water in your mouth and swallow slowly to avoid coughing.

2. Avoid eating cold, sweet foods or drinks, and temporarily avoid citrus fruits (oranges, tangerines, grapefruits, lemons).

3. Avoid cold air stimulation; wear a mask and scarf if necessary. Avoid smoking and dust irritation.

4. If you have phlegm, take deep breaths to cough it out (press your hand on your abdomen or lie down with both hands hugging your knees).

5. After taking cough syrup, do not drink water or eat anything for half an hour.

6. During coughing, wear a mask to prevent spreading to others.

7. Take medication according to the doctor's instructions and undergo outpatient follow-up treatment.

8. If you have persistent high fever, asthma, a large amount of yellow phlegm, severe dry cough, hemoptysis, or cyanosis, please return for a follow-up as soon as possible.

9. If you have fever, cough, or diarrhea, and have traveled abroad or had close contact with a suspected SARS patient, you may be infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). If symptoms are not effectively relieved or worsen after medical treatment, please return to the hospital for treatment as soon as possible.
