## Liver Cirrhosis Precautions

1. Follow a high-carbohydrate and high-protein diet (e.g., fish, meat, eggs, dairy); however, protein intake should be restricted if hepatic encephalopathy occurs.

2. For patients with esophageal varices, avoid rough, hard, or excessively hot foods, and chew slowly and thoroughly.

3. Patients with ascites or edema should follow a low-salt diet and limit fluid intake.

4. Eat small, frequent meals, maintain a regular lifestyle, get adequate rest, avoid strenuous exercise, and abstain from smoking and alcohol.

5. Prevent infections, monitor for signs of bleeding (e.g., skin bruising, gum bleeding, black stools), and attend regular outpatient follow-ups.

6. Avoid straining during bowel movements, consume more vegetables and fruits, and prevent constipation.

7. Seek immediate medical attention if experiencing massive hematemesis, melena, severe jaundice, coma, or abdominal pain with fever.
