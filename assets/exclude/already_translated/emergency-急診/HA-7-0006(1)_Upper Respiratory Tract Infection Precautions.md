## Upper Respiratory Tract Infection Precautions

1. Fever may occur intermittently for 3~5 days, which is a normal process. Please take medication as prescribed by your doctor and drink plenty of warm water. If the ear temperature exceeds 38℃ without chills, use an ice pillow. If it exceeds 38.5℃, take a warm bath.

2. When coughing severely, drink more warm water and avoid cold, sweet drinks and citrus fruits. If there is phlegm, use abdominal muscles and combine with deep breathing to help expel phlegm. When going out, wear a mask to avoid cold air stimulation.

3. Ensure sufficient rest and consume more vegetables and fruits.

4. When feverish, remain calm. If necessary, call to inquire whether another emergency room visit is required. Regular outpatient follow-ups are also needed (Emergency Room Hotline: 615-0995).

5. If experiencing persistent high fever, headache with stiff neck, difficulty breathing, large amounts of yellow phlegm, or inability to swallow saliva, please return to the emergency room for treatment.
