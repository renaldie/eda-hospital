## Precautions for Lower Back Pain

1. Try to lie flat on the bed to allow your lower back to rest and relax.

2. During acute lower back pain, avoid getting out of bed on your own. It's best to have someone help you, and only get up when absolutely necessary (e.g., to use the restroom).

3. When lying on your back, place a pillow under your knees; when lying on your side, place the pillow between your knees.

4. Massaging or applying a warm compress (37°C, close to body temperature) to the lower back can provide comfort, but be careful to avoid burns. However, if the lower back pain is caused by an injury, avoid heat compresses for the first two days and use ice instead.

5. Avoid lifting or pulling heavy objects.

6. Avoid using your lower back strength to lift heavy objects. If you need to pick up something from the floor, keep your back straight, bend your knees, and squat down to lift it.

7. Regular follow-up outpatient visits are necessary.

8. If you experience high fever, progressive paralysis of the lower limbs, urinary incontinence, lower back pain accompanied by cold sweats, or shock, please return for immediate medical attention.
