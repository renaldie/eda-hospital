## Precautions for Sprains or Muscle Strains

1. Rest more, avoid further activity, and reduce the risk of re-injury.

2. Generally, the most painful period occurs 2~3 days after injury. At this time, apply ice to the injured area, and continue this step for 24~48 hours.

（1）Place a small amount of ice cubes in the ice bag and add one-third water

（2）Invert the ice bag to check for leaks, wrap the ice bag with a dry towel, and apply ice to the affected area.

（3）Apply ice four times a day, each time for 15~20 minutes with rest intervals.

3. Elevate the affected limb as much as possible, wear properly sized shoes (avoid high heels), and do not massage.

4. If the pain is unbearable, or if swelling and bruising continue to increase despite treatment, seek medical attention.
