## Precautions for Acute Gastroenteritis in Children

1. During the acute phase, reduce or temporarily stop eating. If thirsty during fasting, moisten lips with water.

2. If there is no persistent diarrhea, temporarily discontinue laxatives.

3. Avoid dehydration and pay attention to water and electrolyte replenishment. Sports drinks diluted with equal parts water can be consumed.

4. Avoid drinking milk and dairy products, oily foods, and spicy foods.

5. After symptoms improve, try giving plain water. If no discomfort, gradually introduce small amounts of bland food (e.g., rice porridge, congee, white bread, juice).

6. If vomiting recurs, rest for a few hours before resuming eating.

7. Prevention methods: frequent handwashing, attention to cooking environment, and emphasis on food hygiene.

8. Mild diarrhea can be managed at home with rest. However, seek medical attention immediately if there is persistent vomiting, continuous watery diarrhea, dehydration shock, persistent abdominal pain, infants showing continuous restlessness or crying, pain shifting to the lower right abdomen, loss of appetite, or symptoms such as confusion, lethargy, poor activity, or near inability to eat.
