## Precautions for Patients with Difficulty Breathing and Their Families

1. Difficulty breathing is one of the symptoms of many heart, lung, and respiratory diseases. If you or your family members experience symptoms of difficulty breathing, you should pay close attention and monitor any changes. Do not take it lightly, regardless of whether you have a history of heart or lung diseases.

2. Patients with chronic diseases should take their medications as instructed by their physicians. If there are any changes in their condition, they should visit the relevant outpatient department for further follow-up examinations within a few days, or seek immediate medical attention.

3. When experiencing difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, or cyanosis, first let the patient sit upright. Do not feed them, and avoid allowing them to move around随意. Administer oxygen or emergency medication to the patient as instructed by the physician to alleviate symptoms, and seek immediate medical attention.

4. After discharge from Yi Da Hospital, if patients with difficulty breathing experience persistent high fever, chest pain, cold sweats, cyanosis, inability to lie flat and sleep, or lower limb edema, please go directly to the emergency room for assistance.
