## Precautions for Children with Fever

1. Rest in bed more, increase fluid intake and juice, glucose water or glucose electrolyte solution.

2. Avoid wearing too many clothes or covering with thick blankets. If clothes become wet, change them immediately.

3. Maintain a normal indoor temperature, take medication regularly as prescribed by the doctor.

4. Measure body temperature every 4 hours; if ear temperature is above 39°C without chills, use an ice pillow or take a lukewarm bath (water temperature 30-34°C) to reduce body temperature. If ear temperature is above 38°C, take oral fever-reducing medication as instructed by the doctor. If ear temperature is above 38.5°C, use rectal suppositories as instructed by the doctor. Suppositories should be used with an interval of 4-6 hours (suppositories should be refrigerated in the refrigerator to prevent melting).

5. Stay calm when a child has a fever, observe the child's mental state and energy levels. If necessary, contact the hospital by phone to inquire if another emergency visit is needed; follow-up outpatient care.

6. If there are symptoms such as persistent high fever, headache and stiff neck, difficulty breathing, large amounts of yellow phlegm, poor appetite, drowsiness, poor activity, or almost unable to eat, please return for a follow-up visit as soon as possible.
