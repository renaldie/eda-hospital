## Urinary Tract Stones

1. Sudden onset of sharp and severe pain radiating from the waist to the surrounding areas, downward to the testicles in males and to the bladder in females.

2. When the pain is severe, nausea, vomiting, pallor, cold sweat may occur, and there may be frequent urination or difficulty in urination.

3. Drink at least 3000～4000 CC of liquid daily (about 8 large cups) as instructed, which can increase urine output, lower the concentration of solutes in urine, and reduce urine stasis.

4. Urinate once every 2 hours, do not hold urine, to avoid urine stasis.

5. Regular outpatient follow-up to determine whether the stone has passed.
