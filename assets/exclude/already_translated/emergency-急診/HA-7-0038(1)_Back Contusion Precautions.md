# Precautions for Back Contusions

1. Lie flat as much as possible and rest more.

2. Avoid bending over to lift heavy objects.

3. When moving, you can support the painful area with your hands to relieve pain.

4. For the first two days after injury, apply ice packs, which can help reduce swelling and relieve pain.

(1) Put an appropriate amount of ice cubes into the ice bag and add water to one-third full.

(2) Invert the ice bag to check for leaks, wrap the ice bag with a dry towel, and apply it to the affected area.

(3) Apply ice four times a day, each session lasting 15~20 minutes with rest in between.

5. Take medication as prescribed by the doctor and return for regular follow-up examinations.

6. If there is hematuria, back pain combined with cold sweats, please seek emergency care immediately.
