## ☐ Oral Trauma Precautions

1. After each meal, rinse your mouth with warm salt water or mouthwash to keep your mouth clean.

2. For oral surgical wounds, stitches generally do not require removal. However, if the suture thread is still present or you feel a foreign body sensation 10 days later, please consult the oral and maxillofacial surgery outpatient clinic for treatment.

3. Please consume liquid or soft foods (e.g., juice, milk, porridge) based on your individual condition. Avoid rough, spicy, or hot foods.

4. If the wound shows signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, pain, discharge, fever, or if you experience abnormal pain, high fever, or chills, please return for a visit as soon as possible.

5. Please return for follow-up visits on time.
