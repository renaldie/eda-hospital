## CT Simulation Procedure

The CT simulation machine can scan the three-dimensional anatomical structure of the human body, providing images needed for radiation therapy. At the same time, molds to fix the body are made in the CT simulation room to assist in daily posture fixation during subsequent radiation therapy. Please remove any metal objects on your body before the CT simulation. Patients who need contrast agent injection should fast for four hours before the injection. Before the simulation, the nurse will first insert an intravenous catheter for you. After the needle is inserted, please wait in the waiting area.

After entering the CT simulation room, the radiotherapist will guide you to cooperate with the CT simulation. If you feel unwell (such as pain, cough, or sputum), please inform the radiotherapist immediately.

Different treatment positions are used depending on the treatment site, and the posture is the same for each treatment. Therefore, if you feel uncomfortable when the radiotherapist positions you, please inform the radiotherapist immediately to assist in adjusting your posture.

When making the fixation mold, it will feel warm and slightly tight when worn because a certain degree of tightness is necessary to help fix your position during each treatment (the example picture shows a head fixation mold; different molds will be made depending on the treatment site). After the fixation mold cools, before scanning the CT images, the nurse will come to inject the contrast agent. The contrast agent itself is warm, so feeling warmth after injection is normal. After the simulation is completed, if you do not feel unwell, you can ask the nurse to remove the needle (the removal site is the same as where the needle was inserted). If there are no other fasting-required examinations, you can drink more water to help eliminate the contrast agent from your body. The treatment schedule will be notified to you by phone later.

## Precautions

The radiotherapist will draw black lines and marks on your body, which are used for positioning and posture correction before radiation therapy, not the treatment site. Please be careful when bathing! You can rinse with clean water but do not use soap to scrub or rub hard. If the black line markings disappear, do not redraw them yourself; wait for the radiotherapist to handle it during treatment.
