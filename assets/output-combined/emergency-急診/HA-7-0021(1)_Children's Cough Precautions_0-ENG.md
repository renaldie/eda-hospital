## Children's Cough Precautions

1. When the throat feels itchy, slowly swallow warm boiled water to avoid coughing.

2. Avoid eating ice, sweets, or drinks, and temporarily avoid citrus fruits (oranges, tangerines, grapefruits, lemons).

3. Avoid stimulation from cold air; wear a mask or scarf if necessary. Avoid secondhand smoke and dust irritation.

4. Take medication as prescribed and follow up with outpatient treatment. If there is a high fever, cough, with or without diarrhea, and a recent history of international travel, or if symptoms do not improve effectively or continue to worsen after seeking medical care, please seek medical attention promptly.

5. If there is persistent high fever, difficulty breathing, large amounts of yellow phlegm, severe dry cough, coughing up blood, or cyanosis, please seek medical attention immediately.

6. During coughing, wear a mask to prevent infecting others.
