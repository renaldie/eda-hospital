## Precautions for Using a Triangular Bandage

1. The triangular bandage must be clean.

2. When in use, the elbow joint should remain bent upward at less than 90 degrees; the wrist and forearm should not hang down.

3. When bandaging the limb, try to expose the end of the limb to allow for continuous observation of local blood circulation.

4. According to medical instructions, the bandage can be temporarily removed during sleep for rest.

5. If the hand becomes abnormally swollen, numb, or feels unusual, a follow-up examination is required.
