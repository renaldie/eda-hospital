## Precautions for Lower Back Pain

1. Try to lie flat on the bed as much as possible to allow your lower back to rest and relax.

2. During acute lower back pain, do not get out of bed by yourself; it is best to ask for help and only get out of bed when necessary (such as going to the bathroom).

3. When lying flat, you can place a pillow under both knees; when sleeping on your side, you can place a pillow between your knees.

4. Massaging or applying heat to the lower back (at 37 degrees, close to body temperature) can make you feel comfortable, but be careful to avoid burns (if the lower back pain is caused by trauma, avoid heat for the first 2 days and use ice instead).

5. Avoid lifting or pulling heavy objects.

6. Do not use your waist strength to lift heavy objects. If you want to pick something up from the ground, keep your back straight, bend your knees, and squat down to pick it up.

7. Regular follow-up visits to the clinic are necessary.

8. If you experience high fever, progressive paralysis of the lower limbs, urinary incontinence, back pain accompanied by cold sweats, shock, or other such symptoms, please return to the clinic promptly.
