## Precautions for Hypokalemia

1. Applicable to: Patients with low blood potassium

2. Consume more potassium-rich foods, such as bananas, oranges, tangerines, guava, persimmons, cantaloupe, tomatoes, dark green vegetables, chicken essence, and meat broth.

3. If diarrhea or vomiting persists, or if symptoms do not improve after seeking medical care, or muscle weakness worsens, return to the emergency room.

4. The cause of hypokalemia should be evaluated at an endocrinology or nephrology outpatient clinic for further diagnosis and treatment.
