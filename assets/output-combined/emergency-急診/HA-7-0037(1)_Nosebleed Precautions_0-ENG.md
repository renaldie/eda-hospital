## Precautions for Nosebleeds

1. Avoid staying in air-conditioned rooms for long periods or picking your nose to prevent dryness and cracking of the nasal mucosa, which can lead to nosebleeds or infections.

2. When a nosebleed occurs, stopping the bleeding is the priority. Have the patient sit up; if necessary, insert a tissue strip into the nostril. If bleeding does not stop, apply pressure to the bridge of the nose or use ice packs (for trauma patients, do not block the nostrils arbitrarily to prevent blood from entering the airway and causing choking).

3. For patients with hypertension, if blood pressure readings are higher than usual, take emergency antihypertensive medication as directed by a physician, rest, avoid strenuous activities and walking, maintain a semi-recumbent position, and focus on stopping the bleeding.

4. Follow the emergency physician’s medication recommendations and related medication instructions; do not remove nasal packing or cotton swabs inserted after medical treatment without permission, and return for follow-up examinations as instructed by the physician.

5. If you regularly take antithrombotic drugs (for heart surgery or ischemic stroke patients), aspirin, or have coagulation disorders (hemophilia, cirrhosis or liver cancer, hematopoietic dysfunction), or head and neck cancer (such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma), seek immediate medical attention if bleeding cannot be stopped.
