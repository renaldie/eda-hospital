## Precautions for Seizures

1. When a seizure occurs, lay the patient flat with their head turned to one side to prevent vomit from blocking the airway. If the jaw is clenched and the tongue is bitten and bleeding, do not forcefully pry open the teeth.

2. Do not forcibly restrain the patient's limbs or try to stop their convulsions. Guide the patient to sit or lie down to prevent head injury, keep them away from danger to avoid fractures or other injuries.

3. Observe and record the time of the seizure, symptoms, what the patient was doing during the seizure, and the duration of the seizure to assist the doctor in diagnosis and treatment; seek immediate medical attention.

4. Patients with a history of seizures should take medication as prescribed by their doctor, avoid infections, fever, strong auditory or visual stimuli, do not drink alcohol, maintain a balanced diet and adequate sleep, and have regular outpatient follow-ups for control.
