## Urinary Tract Stones

1. Sudden onset of sharp and severe pain, extending from the waist to the surrounding areas; in males, the pain extends downward to the testicles, and in females, to the bladder.

2. When the pain is severe, symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, paleness, and cold sweats may occur, along with frequent urination or difficulty urinating.

3. Follow instructions to drink at least 3000–4000 C.C. of fluids daily (about 8 large cups) to increase urine output, reduce the concentration of solutes in the urine, and decrease urine retention.

4. Urinate once every 2 hours; do not hold urine to avoid urine retention.

5. Regular outpatient follow-up is necessary to confirm whether the stones have been passed.
