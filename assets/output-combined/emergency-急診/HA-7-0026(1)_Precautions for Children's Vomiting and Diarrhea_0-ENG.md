## Precautions for Children’s Vomiting and Diarrhea

Vomiting:

Temporarily fast for a few hours. If thirsty, try giving small amounts of water to soothe the throat, but avoid drinking large amounts of water to prevent a second wave of vomiting. If vomiting persists, consult a doctor to check for dehydration or electrolyte changes, and provide intravenous fluids if necessary.

Diarrhea:

First, fast to allow the gastrointestinal tract to rest. During this period, give the child the doctor-recommended "glucose electrolyte solution," allowing them to drink it irregularly as needed, but avoid undiluted sports drinks, as their high sugar content can worsen diarrhea. After eight hours, if diarrhea improves, infants primarily fed on milk can try half-strength milk (same amount of water but half the amount of milk powder), while older children can stop drinking milk and start eating rice water, rice cereal diluted with water, or bland foods such as congee or toast that are neither oily nor sweet.

If diarrhea does not improve within one to three days, do not continue feeding diluted milk powder (no milk powder should be used diluted long-term). Instead, switch to special formula milk (such as lactose-free milk powder containing cow’s milk protein or lactose-free milk powder containing plant-based protein) to reduce irritation to the intestines. At this time, the original milk should be completely stopped until diarrhea improves, then gradually reintroduced.
