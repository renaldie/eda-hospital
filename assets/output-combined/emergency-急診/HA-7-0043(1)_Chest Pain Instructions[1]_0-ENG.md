## Chest Pain Notice

1. Chest pain is one of the symptoms of many cardiovascular, pulmonary, and chest wall musculoskeletal and neurological diseases. It may indicate a serious condition and should not be taken lightly.

2. If the chest pain is severe or lasts for a long time without relief, or if the chest pain is accompanied by symptoms such as shortness of breath, cold sweats, fainting, or other physical discomforts, please seek medical treatment promptly.

3. Patients with chronic diseases should take their medications as prescribed and should not stop taking them without reason, especially heart disease patients who need to be particularly careful.

4. For emergency chest pain, you can seek assistance at the emergency room.

5. After discharge from the emergency room, chest pain patients still need to follow the doctor's instructions to visit the relevant outpatient departments for follow-up in the near future to detect any potential diseases.
