## Asthma Precautions

1. To prevent attacks, please carry your medication with you at all times for emergencies and use it according to your doctor's instructions.

2. Avoid contact with allergens such as cigarette smoke, smoke, pollen, cold air, dust, dust mites, or pets.

3. Wear a mask and scarf when there are large temperature differences; during cold and flu season, avoid public places; engage in appropriate exercise and maintain a balanced and moderate diet.

4. During an acute asthma attack, please first provide the patient with oxygen or bronchodilators as directed by the doctor; when symptoms ease, have the patient sit up, avoid feeding them temporarily, and do not allow them to get out of bed and move around freely.

5. If acute wheezing, rapid breathing, cyanosis, or if inhaled sprays do not effectively relieve symptoms, or if there is high fever, chills, cough with large amounts of yellow sputum, please return to the clinic promptly.
