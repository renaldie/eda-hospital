## Medical Rights and Interests for Victims of Sexual Assault

1. When you come to our hospital for treatment, we will not refuse your medical needs without reason, and you will be classified as a first-level emergency patient for injury examination, receiving priority treatment.

2. If our hospital's equipment or technology cannot provide you with complete diagnosis and treatment, we will proactively arrange a referral for you and provide detailed information about the name and address of the referred medical institution to you or your accompanying family members, so that you can receive comprehensive care.

3. When you receive diagnosis and treatment at our hospital, social workers or nursing staff will accompany you during the injury examination, and if you need family members to accompany you, they may also be present to assist.

4. During the injury examination and evidence collection process, we will provide a private and warm environment to avoid unnecessary disturbances.

5. The medical and evidence collection fees incurred due to this incident will be paid by the local government of your registered residence, and you will not bear any costs.

6. Regarding the results of your diagnosis and treatment, you or your spouse, legal representative (if you are a minor and unmarried, your parents are your legal representatives) may apply to our hospital for the issuance of an injury examination diagnosis certificate.

7. To protect your rights, during your diagnosis and treatment, our hospital can simultaneously assist in collecting evidence and conducting injury examinations as evidence for you to file a complaint. The doctor will examine your more private areas during the diagnosis; if you feel any discomfort during the process, you may inform the medical staff, who will assist you accordingly.

8. The collection of the above evidence and injury examination will only proceed with your consent after you sign the injury examination and evidence collection consent form. The collected evidence will be stored in evidence bags and handed over to the police for subsequent assistance. These pieces of evidence will be strictly protected and will not be disclosed.

9. If you have any questions, you can seek consultation through the National Women and Children's Protection Hotline 113, which will provide you with detailed explanations and help you receive follow-up assistance.

Respectfully,  
Social Work Department, E-Da Hospital
