## Home Care Instructions for Plaster Cast

1. Purpose of the plaster cast: To immobilize the bone, maintain the normal functional position of the fractured bone, and allow the bone to heal itself.

2. Care for the limb after applying the plaster cast:

(1) Keep the fingers and toes of the casted limb clean, apply lotion, and gently massage to prevent dryness and cracking.

(2) Do not insert sharp objects into the plaster to avoid skin damage, and teach children not to put toys, food, toothbrushes, buttons, or other items inside the cast.

(3) Avoid hitting the plaster against hard objects, as this may cause deformation or cracking.

(4) Keep the plaster clean and dry.

(5) Elevate the casted limb slightly above heart level to promote blood return and reduce swelling and pain.

(6) Perform muscle contraction exercises, each lasting 15–20 minutes, three times a day. For example: clenching fists.

(7) Practice lifting and lowering the casted limb daily while in bed or sitting on a chair.

3. When to return to the clinic for follow-up after applying the plaster cast:

4. If the fingertips (toes) of the casted limb feel swollen, painful, pale, purple, cold, or numb.

5. If the plaster is cracked or broken.

6. If the plaster feels too loose or too tight.

7. If there is a particular sharp pain or discomfort on the skin inside the plaster.

8. Avoid eating irritating foods and overeating.
