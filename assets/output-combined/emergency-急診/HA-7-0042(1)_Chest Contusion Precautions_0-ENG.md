## Chest Contusion Precautions

1. After excluding pneumothorax or rib fractures in chest trauma, there may still be potential lung contusions. The patient's breathing condition should be closely monitored.

2. If there is obvious swelling in the neck, difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, cold sweats, pale complexion, cyanosis, severe chest pain, or back discomfort, medical personnel should be notified immediately.

3. After returning home, take medication as prescribed by the doctor, get plenty of rest, avoid strenuous work, and return for follow-up appointments as scheduled.

4. If severe symptoms such as coughing up blood, difficulty breathing, or rapid breathing occur at home, sit upright, avoid feeding and getting out of bed, and call for advice or return to the hospital for treatment (Emergency line: 615-0995).
