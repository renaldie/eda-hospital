## Precautions for Children with Upper Respiratory Tract Infection

1. Intermittent fever lasting 3-5 days is common and a normal process. Please take medication as prescribed and drink plenty of warm boiled water. If the temperature exceeds 38°C without chills, an ice pillow can be used; if the temperature exceeds 38.5°C, antipyretics can be used.

2. When coughing severely, drink more warm boiled water and avoid cold, sweet drinks and citrus fruits. Wearing a mask when going out can help avoid irritation from cold air.

3. Ensure adequate rest and consume plenty of vegetables and fruits.

4. Stay calm during fever, pay attention to the child's mental alertness, and call to inquire if emergency medical care is needed; also have regular outpatient follow-ups.

5. If high fever persists for several days, mental activity is poor, there is a large amount of yellow phlegm, drowsiness, or inability to eat, please return to the clinic promptly.
