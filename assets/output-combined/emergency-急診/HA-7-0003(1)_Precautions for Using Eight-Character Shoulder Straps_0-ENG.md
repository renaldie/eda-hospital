## Precautions for Using the Figure-8 Shoulder Strap

1. Most clavicle fractures can be effectively treated with a figure-8 shoulder strap fixation. Only a few clavicle fractures require surgical intervention, which can be determined by an orthopedic doctor at the orthopedic outpatient clinic.

2. The figure-8 shoulder strap should be worn for 4-6 weeks or even up to three months. Usually, during the first 2 weeks of use, an arm sling can be used simultaneously to immobilize the affected arm and reduce pain.

3. It is best to wipe the body instead of taking a shower during the first 1-2 weeks, and the figure-8 shoulder strap should not be removed while wiping. If showering is absolutely necessary, be sure to maintain the correct posture and carefully remove the figure-8 shoulder strap. After showering, put it back on as soon as possible (hands on hips, chest out, with family assistance from behind to adjust the shoulder pads and evenly tighten the two straps on both sides). If uncomfortable, please return to the clinic promptly for assistance.

4. Wear the figure-8 shoulder strap over a thin cotton garment, not over thick clothing; when sleeping, lie flat on your back and avoid lying on your side.

5. Pain usually lasts for 1-2 weeks. Painkillers prescribed by the doctor can be taken, and regular follow-up visits to the orthopedic outpatient clinic are necessary.
