## Precautions for Infant Croup

If a child suddenly has a hoarse voice, a cough that sounds like a dog barking, inspiratory stridor, and difficulty breathing, this may be an episode of croup, which commonly occurs in children aged one to three years. Because infants have narrower bronchi, inflammation can easily cause mucus blockage, compressing the airflow passing through the inflamed vocal cords, producing the characteristic sound.

Croup mostly occurs on winter nights. Some children suddenly have an episode at night, resulting in poor sleep, a barking cough, hoarseness, and inspiratory stridor. In addition to medication, treatment includes adequate hydration and inhalation of cool, moist air. For example, using the steam from a bathroom or a facial steamer for about fifteen minutes each time can naturally dilate the child's airways and help relieve symptoms. If the child's breathing difficulties do not improve, immediate emergency treatment is necessary.
