## Precautions for Children with Acute Gastroenteritis

1. During the acute phase, reduce or temporarily stop eating; during fasting, if thirsty, moisten lips with water.

2. If diarrhea is not persistent, laxatives can be temporarily stopped.

3. Avoid dehydration; pay attention to water and electrolyte replenishment; diluted sports drinks (half water, half sports drink) can be consumed.

4. Try to avoid milk and soy products, greasy foods, and irritating foods.

5. After symptoms improve, try giving plain water; if no discomfort occurs, gradually provide small amounts of light foods (such as porridge, rice water, white toast, juice).

6. If vomiting recurs, rest for a few hours before eating again.

7. Prevention methods: wash hands frequently, pay attention to cooking environment, and emphasize food hygiene.

8. Mild diarrhea can be managed at home with rest. If vomiting persists, diarrhea continues, dehydration shock occurs, abdominal pain persists, infants cry continuously and are restless, pain shifts to the lower right abdomen, loss of appetite, or if there is confusion, drowsiness, poor activity, or almost no food intake, please return to the clinic promptly.
