# Post-Liver Biopsy Care Instructions

## 1. Definition

Liver biopsy is an invasive examination. The physician uses ultrasound guidance to obtain several small pieces of liver tissue with a puncture needle for pathological diagnosis, which helps determine the treatment plan or assess the progression of liver disease.

## 2. Applicable Patients

Patients who have undergone liver biopsy.

## 3. Care and Precautions

### 1. When can eating begin?

One hour after the examination, if vital signs are stable and there is no discomfort, you may start drinking small amounts of water. If there is no discomfort, gradually begin eating.

### 2. Sandbag pressure and bed rest time

Absolute bed rest is required for four hours after the examination, with a sandbag applied to the puncture site to prevent bleeding. During this time, nursing staff will monitor your blood pressure and heart rate according to medical orders and assess your condition.

### 3. Wound pain management

Mild abdominal pain can be treated with pain medication. If you experience severe abdominal pain, difficulty breathing, cold sweats, rapid heartbeat, or altered consciousness, notify medical staff immediately.

Do not get the wound wet on the day of the procedure. Keep the area dry and clean the next day as usual.# Post-Liver Tissue Biopsy Care Instructions
