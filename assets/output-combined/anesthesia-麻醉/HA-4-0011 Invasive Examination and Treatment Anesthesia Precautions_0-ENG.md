## Invasive Examination and Treatment Anesthesia Education Sheet

The process for invasive examination and treatment anesthesia is as follows:

1. For those who have completed the anesthesia assessment, please arrive 30 minutes early on the day of the examination for pre-examination preparation; for those who have not completed the anesthesia assessment, please arrive 1 hour early at the check-in time and go to the third-floor anesthesia assessment clinic for evaluation.

2. On the day of the examination, fasting (no food) from regular meals or fatty foods for at least 8 hours; light meals and dairy products for 6 hours; breast milk for 4 hours; clear fluids such as plain water or clear tea for more than 2 hours are sufficient. If you are taking blood sugar-lowering medication, do not take it on the day; for hypertension medication, if the examination is in the morning, take it before 6:00 AM on the day of the examination; if the examination is in the afternoon, take it before 9:00 AM on the day of the examination.

3. If you have removable dentures, nail polish, or contact lenses, please remove them first.

4. On the day of the examination and treatment, a family member must accompany you. Do not drive yourself home to ensure safety. If there is no family member to accompany you, considering the safety after medication, the examination and treatment anesthesia cannot be performed. Thank you for your understanding!

5. Outpatient anesthesia fees must be paid before the examination; inpatient fees are to be paid upon discharge.
