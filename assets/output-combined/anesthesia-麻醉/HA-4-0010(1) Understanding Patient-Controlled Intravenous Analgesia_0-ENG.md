## What is Intravenous Patient Controlled Analgesia

Pain medication is stored in an infusion pump, and the dosage is set according to the patient's pain condition. When you feel pain, you can press the control button yourself to administer the pain medication intravenously, achieving pain relief.

This is an advanced medication device. When you feel pain, you can press the medication button yourself, and the machine will inject the pain medication, quickly achieving pain relief in about 5 minutes.

## Applicable Scope of Patient Controlled Analgesia

Pain caused by surgical wounds, other fractures and injuries, cancer pain, etc.

## Common Side Effects

Since the medication used is an opioid analgesic, possible discomfort symptoms include: nausea, vomiting, abdominal bloating, dizziness, skin itching, difficulty urinating, drowsiness, and sleepiness. If you experience any of the above, please inform the ward nursing staff to contact the pain nurse for handling.

## How to Use Patient Controlled Analgesia

Currently, National Health Insurance does not cover patient controlled analgesia; it must be paid for out-of-pocket and cannot be reimbursed or used by others. If you need it, you can inform the pre-anesthesia evaluation clinic or ward nursing staff of your intention to use it.
