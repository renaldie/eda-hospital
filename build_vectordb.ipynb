The machine continuously administers pain medication, allowing the anesthetic pain medication to enter the epidural space through the catheter, locally blocking the nerves that transmit pain signals, thereby achieving pain relief. When the patient feels pain, they can press the control button themselves to supplement the medication.\n",

      "2. On the day of the examination, fasting (no food) from regular meals or fatty foods for at least 8 hours; light meals and dairy products for 6 hours; breast milk for 4 hours; clear fluids such as plain water or clear tea for more than 2 hours are sufficient. If you are taking blood sugar-lowering medication, do not take it on the day; for hypertension medication, if the examination is in the morning, take it before 6:00 AM on the day of the examination; if the examination is in the afternoon, take it before 9:00 AM on the day of the examination.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. If you have removable dentures, nail polish, or contact lenses, please remove them first.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. On the day of the examination and treatment, a family member must accompany you. Do not drive yourself home to ensure safety. If there is no family member to accompany you, considering the safety after medication, the examination and treatment anesthesia cannot be performed. Thank you for your understanding!\n",

If unsure whether the drop has entered the eye, you may apply one more drop.

During this period, give the child the doctor-recommended \"glucose electrolyte solution,\" allowing them to drink it irregularly as needed, but avoid undiluted sports drinks, as their high sugar content can worsen diarrhea. After eight hours, if diarrhea improves, infants primarily fed on milk can try half-strength milk (same amount of water but half the amount of milk powder), while older children can stop drinking milk and start eating rice water, rice cereal diluted with water, or bland foods such as congee or toast that are neither oily nor sweet.\n",
      "\n",
      "If diarrhea does not improve within one to three days, do not continue feeding diluted milk powder (no milk powder should be used diluted long-term). Instead, switch to special formula milk (such as lactose-free milk powder containing cow’s milk protein or lactose-free milk powder containing plant-based protein) to reduce irritation to the intestines. At this time, the original milk should be completely stopped until diarrhea improves, then gradually reintroduced.\n",

      "### 1. Causes of Febrile Seizures:\n",
      "\n",
      "When a child has a fever, convulsions may occur in the whole body or in localized limbs, often accompanied by temporary loss of consciousness; this is called a febrile seizure. It usually occurs within the first 24 hours of the fever onset, mostly happens only once, stops within a few minutes, the child wakes up shortly afterward, and there are no subsequent paralysis or mental confusion symptoms. Fortunately, febrile seizures rarely occur after the age of five.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. How to Handle Febrile Seizures?\n",
      "\n",
      "Since simple febrile seizures rarely pose immediate danger and do not cause neurological sequelae, it is important to stay calm. First, lay the child flat on a safe bed or floor where they will not slip. Measure the body temperature and use a rectal suppository to reduce the fever. If vomiting occurs, turn the head to the side and clear the vomit to keep the airway open. If there is no obvious tongue biting, do not place any objects in the mouth to prevent tongue biting, as this may cause choking or induce vomiting. Monitor breathing and heartbeat for normalcy. If convulsions continue for several minutes, seek immediate medical attention. For children who have awakened, closely observe for signs of impaired consciousness, persistent vomiting, severe headache, neck stiffness and pain, persistent high fever, or signs of limb paralysis.\n",

At the same time, molds to fix the body are made in the CT room to assist in daily posture fixation during subsequent radiation therapy. Please remove any metal objects from your body before undergoing CT localization. Patients who need contrast agent injection should fast for four hours before the injection. Before localization, the nurse will first insert an intravenous catheter for you. After the catheter is placed, please wait in the waiting area.\n",
      "\n",
      "After entering the CT localization room, the radiotherapist will guide you to cooperate with the CT localization procedure. If you feel unwell (such as pain, coughing, or sputum), please inform the radiotherapist immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Different treatment sites require different treatment postures, and the posture is the same for each treatment session. Therefore, if you feel uncomfortable when the radiotherapist positions you, please inform the radiotherapist immediately to assist in adjusting your posture.\n",
      "\n",
      "When making the fixation mold, you will feel a wet and warm sensation and a certain tightness when wearing it. This tightness is necessary to help fix your position during each treatment session (the example picture shows a head fixation mold; different molds will be made depending on the treatment site).\n",
      "HA-12-0008(1) Computer Tomography Localization Procedure_1-ENG.md\n",
      "After the fixed mold has cooled, before scanning the CT images, the nurse will come to inject the contrast agent. The contrast agent itself is warm, so it is normal to feel a warm sensation after it is injected into the body. After positioning is completed, if there is no discomfort in the body, you can ask the nurse to remove the needle (the needle removal site is the same place where the injection was given). If there are no other examinations requiring fasting, you can drink more water to help eliminate the contrast agent from the body. The time for subsequent treatment will be notified by phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Precautions\n",
      "\n",
      "The radiologist will draw black lines and marks on the body, which are used by the radiologist for positioning and posture correction before radiotherapy, not for the treatment location. Be careful when bathing! You can rinse with clean water, but do not use soap to scrub or rub hard. If the black line markings disappear, do not redraw them yourself; wait until treatment to have the radiologist handle it.\n",

      "\n",
      "The liver has regenerative capabilities. Generally, only 15-20% of a standard liver is needed to meet normal physiological demands. However, during donation surgery, the safety of the living donor must be prioritized, so at least 35% of the donor’s total liver volume must be preserved. The volume of liver donated in living liver donation is determined based on the recipient’s body weight. Typically, the donated volume is 0.8-1% of the recipient’s body weight. The choice of donation site varies depending on whether the recipient is an adult or a child and their body weight. The explanations are as follows:\n",

      "## 4. Possible Complications of Liver Donation Surgery\n",
      "\n",
      "Liver donation is a major surgery. According to literature statistics, the mortality rate for donors is 0.6-1%. Possible complications of this surgery include pleural effusion, intra-abdominal infection and peritonitis, bile leakage, intestinal adhesions, wound infection, etc. The overall incidence of these complications is about 10%. Most complications can be cured with medication, and only a very small number require further invasive treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. Postoperative Recovery and Follow-up\n",
      "\n",
      "The total hospital stay for liver donation surgery is about 10 days. There will be a brief period of abnormal liver function after surgery, which usually returns to normal in about 2-3 weeks. After six months, the liver can regenerate to 90% of its original volume. Light work can be resumed one month after surgery, and weight-bearing work and vigorous activities can be resumed 3-4 months after surgery. Regular outpatient follow-up is still required after discharge.\n",

      "## Preoperative Clinical Evaluation Process for Patients Waiting for Kidney Transplantation\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. What is Kidney Transplantation?\n",
      "\n",
      "Kidney transplantation refers to the surgical procedure of transplanting a functioning kidney (usually donated by the family of a brain-dead patient with consent, a healthy relative within five degrees of kinship, or a spouse) into the recipient to replace the non-functioning kidney and perform the necessary metabolic functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Who is Suitable for Kidney Transplant Surgery?\n",
      "\n",
      "Most patients with end-stage renal failure (uremia) who require hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis to sustain life are generally suitable for kidney transplantation, unless the patient has other contraindications such as malignant tumors, systemic infections, severe cardiovascular diseases, coagulation disorders, chronic respiratory failure, heart failure, psychiatric disorders, severe congenital urinary tract malformations, AIDS, etc. However, evaluation by nephrologists and urologists is still required.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. What is the Success Rate of Kidney Transplant Surgery? What Are the Risks and Complications?\n",
      "\n",
      "The success rate of the surgery depends on the source of the donor: for kidneys donated by healthy relatives, the one-year graft survival rate is over 98%; for kidneys donated by brain-dead donors without kinship, the success rate is about 80-90%. The risks and complications of kidney transplant surgery are similar to those of other surgeries. Most complications can be treated with medication, and only a few severe complications require invasive treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. Can Relatives Donate Kidneys to Each Other?\n",
      "\n",
      "Waiting for a kidney is a matter of chance. According to the Organ Transplant Act, living kidney donation is limited to transplantation to a spouse or blood relatives within five degrees of kinship. The advantages of relative transplantation include shortening the recipient’s waiting time, the donor’s stable health condition, and sufficient time for donor evaluation. Kidney transplantation from relatives has a higher success rate, so more patients are currently receiving kidney transplants from relatives. The conditions for living kidney donors are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Healthy adults aged between 20 and 70 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Both kidneys functioning normally.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. No chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, tuberculosis, no history of tumors, or highly infectious diseases (e.g., AIDS).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Voluntary donation with a pure motive.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. If I Donate a Kidney, What Impact Will It Have on My Health? What Examinations Are Required Before Donation?\n",
      "\n",
      "Under normal circumstances, after donating one kidney, the remaining kidney can take over all kidney functions without adverse effects on overall physiological function. Before donation, the following examinations are required:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Blood typing and tissue matching tests, including mixed lymphocyte culture crossmatch tests.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Liver and kidney function tests, urine analysis, and culture tests.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, and pelvic ultrasound.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Psychiatric and social worker consultations and evaluations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6. Is There a Cost for Living Kidney Transplant Surgery? Does National Health Insurance Cover It? How Long After Surgery Can the Donor Be Discharged? How Long Until Normal Life Can Resume?\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, National Health Insurance covers the preoperative evaluation and surgery for living kidney transplantation, so no out-of-pocket payment is required except for partial costs (such as extra room or meal fees). Donors are generally discharged 5-7 days after surgery. If there are no complications, with proper wound care and regular follow-up visits after discharge, daily life will not be affected.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 7. Post-Transplant Care\n",

      "Kidney transplant surgery involves removing the donor’s kidney and implanting it into the recipient’s lower left or right abdomen. The blood vessels of the new kidney are connected to the recipient’s vessels, and the ureter is connected to the recipient’s bladder. The original kidneys are not removed. The surgery takes about 4-5 hours. Hospitalization lasts about 2 weeks. During hospitalization, transplant surgeons, specialized nurses, and ward nursing staff assist you in adapting to postoperative physical changes, understanding symptoms of rejection and infection, and help you learn self-monitoring and home care. Organ transplant coordinators, clinical pharmacists, and nutritionists also visit to help you understand anti-rejection medications.\n",

      "1. Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty: (commonly known as balloon angioplasty) In this treatment, the doctor will puncture the skin at the groin or hand to perform the procedure. A catheter is inserted into the blood vessel, passed through the narrowed area, and inflated to expand the vessel, widening it and improving blood flow. The doctor will assess your blood vessel condition to decide whether a stent is needed to support the vessel. This surgery is performed under local anesthesia and has a quick recovery time.\n",
